{"review":"Oh dear god, this game will eat your life. Get out before it's too late. I've sunk over 200 hours in and I can't say it was a pleasant experience. Don't fall into the trap.  Seriously though, while this game can be very entertaining with the item combonations that you can make, the actual progression and combat is bland and options for progression are lacking. Most of the rooms are combat-based and a few are \"puzzle-based.\" The combat rooms, while occasionally entertaining, are mostly tedious, and the puzzle rooms are simplistic and extremely tedious. The game is incredibly replayable (I wasn't lying about the 200 hours thing), but that's not neccessarily a good thing when the actual act of playing it is dull. Get addicted to some other game.  Or perhaps I shouldn't be judging so harshly a games I've sunk so much time into. If you want something to get lost in and nothing else, I guess you could do a lot worse. Watch some videos on the game. If it looks like something you'd like to play, it probably will be, but for me, I kind of wish I hadn't bought it.

{"review":"Edit - Oct 14, 2017: So this review isn't helpful? If you truely think this review isn't helpful, you're what's wrong with the game industry. Not only did the publisher censor bad reviews, this game has a DLC for its DLC, and you're defending this practice.  Let me start by saying that The Binding of Isaac is an amazing game. The DLC is where the sh*t hits the fan, and is the reason I'm giving the negative review. You might be thinking to yourself; \"Hey, f*ckface! Why not put the negative review on the DLC page?\" I can't. Nicalis put Afterbirth+ in a bundle to ward off the negative reviews it was getting; a tactic that's generally used for lazy asset flips.  Afterbirth+ is quite possibly the only example of a DLC for a DLC. Yeah, every game has DLC these days, but this is just ridiculous. Anyway, lets see what AB+ adds: A \"new\" floor made entirely out of assets that were already in the game, a \"new\" boss who is also made from reused assets, another alternate version of each floor (actually new content), a few items that are variations upon already existing items, mod tools (see explnation below), and small rooms full of enemies and enemy spawners.  So, other than flipping a few assets, the DLC for the DLC adds variations of each floor, and mod tools. In other games, Civilization for example, mod tools are free to anyone who owns the game. Not only is it free, but its easy to use.  \"Hey, sh*tlord! Just disable Afterbirth Plus!\" - Ah. You see, just like with the original Binding of Isaac, bugfixes are only avaliable to people with the DLC.","hours":157,"funny_percent":0.03571428571428571,"helpful_percent":0.42857142857142855}
{"review":"When it comes to the binding of Isaac rebirth the term if it's not broke don't fix it comes to mind. When it first came out it was better then vaniliah Isaac. With new items, characters, different enemies, and floors. well times have changed. With DLC and \"booster packs\". too many items in the item pool do the same thing. Since the item pool is flooded, and damage is at a premium. I find myself constantly 5 floors in and still have based damage, and this is getting every deal with the devil. Even deals with the devil are not as good....  The game is a shell of what it once was. Because of the dlc's(Thanks afterbirth+) and constant a slow trickle of updates that add very little but reskined items. They also change already good and fun items to be less enjoyable. So myself and others have resorted to hold R until you get a good item on the first floor, which you should not have to do.    I feel the game has shifted from very fun and enjoyable to unbalanced and frusterating. Why even bother taking pills now? There are so many pills 13 to be exact and half of them do the same thing. So don't even bother taking pills and just ignore them all together. Which leaves not only moms bottle of pills useless, but PHD pretty much usless too. That right there sums up what this game has become.    With all that being said Mods make this game more balanced and in my mind a hell of a lot more fun. So I give this review a moderate thumbs up with mods.....but thumbs down without.","hours":344.6,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.38461538461538464}
{"review":"based on experience with afterbirth+.  At this point I have to say that I liked original version with expansions more than this version. yes it has more stuff now, yes it has more enemy variety now, yes it has more room variety now. It sounds wierd, but exactly that variety - is what actually makes this game less and less fun for me. If in earlier iterations you could say \"ah, this item is bad, but I'll take it in case I'll find other item that buffs effects of this\", now you won't say this just because chances of finding an item you want are now dangerously close to zero. Earlier when you heared of people, who restarted the game unless they get desireble first item, you'd smiled on them weaklings, now its the only rational way to play, otherwise you'll be constantly hoping of getting \"next item that finally fixes this run\" for dosens of minutes, till some random chain of events will put you in unwinnable position. Basically the only positive for this game for now is recent addition of workshop. Mods that avaliable in workshop can fix all of this game's issues, but it's not what i \"review\" here.","hours":71.4,"funny_percent":0.038461538461538464,"helpful_percent":0.5}

{"review":"I have some unpopular opinions. My review is at 1.9 hours because that is my absolute limit for stomaching this game.  DISCLAIMER: I am no stranger to repetative, difficult, or grindy games. I grew up with, and still play, the NES. That being said....  PROS: • A creepy storyline that grips you at first • Randomly generated levels & items promotes continuing/replay • Character, enemy, and boss designs are clever and well done • The music is pretty good  CONS: • Game boasts difficulty, but the difficulty actually stems from clunky controls, poor weapon design, and bad hit box locations. • You are not told what items actually do, so you need to alt+tab and refer to an external resource to find out. • Repetative. One life. You die once and you start all over losing all items and progress. This isn't usually a problem with other games, but here I felt like I was working towards nothing. It's just not worth the boring grind when all you get is a picture of the stuff you previously found put into a log. *yawn* • Sorry, but I have to mention it. The levels are so ugly. In all honesty; its poop brown. Poop everywhere! Blood, sweat, and poopy tears! The game starts out interesting with a wacko mother, but then you are forced naked into a bloody poop infested dungeon? Seriously? I'm not that interested in finding out why the poop is so important to this little boy's story.  CONCLUSION: I do not recommend this game for it's flawed controls, poor design, and ugly repetitive gameplay. I'd rather just read the storyline on wikipedia, watch the endings on youtube, and then go play some original Zelda (good gameplay), Tales of the Maj'eyal (a true roguelike), or Dark Souls (repetitive grind with difficulty relying on actual skill).","hours":1.9,"funny_percent":0.07407407407407407,"helpful_percent":0.07407407407407407}

It ruins gaming immersion. OK for not explaining the first time we pick an item, but after that do you really expect us to remember effects of 341 items ? Is it SO complicated to include description \"in-game\" ?  I don't know if it's lazy coding or a game design mistake...  And old music were really better (for my taste).

{"review":"TL/DR: Not even on Sale. This doesn't suit Casual play and will endanger the health of Completionists through stress and physical injury from headdesking/fist through walls etc.  I really truly wish I could recommend this game to you, and this time last year I still may have.  I got into The Binding of Isaac (Wrath of the Lamb) just prior to Rebirth coming out and was able to notch a few hundred hours in it and was very excited for Rebirth. This excited state kept going throughout the period up to Afterbirth, with me bashing my head repeatedly at trying to unlock (or rather gain max lvl in runs) both Meat Boy and Bandage Girl as well as complete The Lost. Despite Items having been changed/nerfed since release with the pretty regular updates during this period, I still enjoyed each run even when not always successful.  Then Afterbirth came in and I continued to enjoy the game with the additional Greed Mode, Dailies, challenges and new characters and Items, going for unlocks and testing the interactivity between pickups, sometimes just seeing the 'Zany'.   More updates happened, tweaks occurred to 'rebalance' certain interactions between Items and Characters. These appeared to occur slightly more frequently than during the Rebirth phase, and the direction seemed to be headed far more into the game 'trolling' you (admittedly the troll aspect was part of the game from the outset, so perhaps I should say it was headed more to a nastier troll i.e. no longer the mutual laugh of a well played harmless prank).  The problem is, as each update hit, it followed the same pattern of nerf/screw with player. The Keeper was a tough character to play is in the early days of Afterbirth, but penny dropping items helped and made it actually possible to complete a run (another admission, I never actually have 'won' a Keeper run, I've got to Isaac a couple of times, but never further). However, these items/trinkets got hit with changes so their effects were negated or at minimum much reduced when playing Keeper, so these avenues for success no longer exist.  A couple of months prior to Afterbirth+ release, it was not fun any more. Runs were taking at least 45 minutes to complete (when successful), Boss Rush and Hush were rarely happening, the Item pools/offerings were uninspiring or outright useless (in context of completing a run) and it seemed each run was directed by a spiteful little child (you know that kid, the one who really needed a spanking from their parent).  OK, so Afterbirth+ fixed this, right?  NOPE.  In fact, It's just gotten worse.  Rules governing floor layouts, item pools, game mechanics, hitboxes, enemy movement have all been changed (in a manner detrimental to any lingering enjoyment). Secret room placement, Devil Deal chances, Floor by floor Item/Boss pools have all be tweaked/changed with a vengence that would have even Lucas uttering 'Whoa, may want to tone it down a bit'  This has gone past Trolling, this is now 'Ha Ha, F@#k You' levels in each and every run.  This game is no longer fun, nor is it 'challenging' (I know someone just thought it)  Sure, this is me being bitter. I think I've thrown enough time into it over the years to be bitter about something so previously enjoyable being destroyed by either deiberate action or an over-zealous and thoughtless tweaking.  Yeah, I think the game is pretty done now and especially too much for someone to get into. Those who would enjoy it (with mod capabilities now), already are. So save your money for something else.","hours":1744.3,"funny_percent":0.25,"helpful_percent":0}

{"review":"Okay, first, look at the time I've spent in this game. No, I didn't leave it on overnight, that is actually the amount of time I have in this game.  The game was FANTASTIC at one point, but update after update (also DLC) has slowly increased the difficulty to the point of unfair levels.  The free updates have caused a slow trickle of community created content, which sounds good on paper. The problem is that most of these items are either bad or reskins of existing ones. In a game where your abilities are dictated on a dice roll, they've diluted the item pool with terrible items, indirectly making the game both harder and less fun.  Let me explain: If you play this game and don't get any damage upgrades, but get a ton of health upgrades, you're likely to die on that run. Enemy health increases as the game goes, and without your damage compensating, you'll be tickling in game enemies with a feather duster. In vanilla Rebirth, this wasn't a big issue. There were plenty of damage upgrades, and maybe a bit more health upgrades than is necessary. However, after so many updates, there just isn't enough damage to go around in lieu of \"wacky\" items from the community.  When the game works out somewhat, it's really good and has tons of replay value, but over time, it's just become a slog of \"well, I haven't gotten any damage upgrades the last few floors, better restart because the next few are both going to be extremely difficult and take an extremely long time because the odds are against me\".  You might call it burnout, but I call it artificial difficulty, and I just can't recommend this game anymore because of it.

While the action feels fun, the music so far is pretty good, and I like some aspects of the art style…….I’m afraid this game has a huge problem which I cannot overlook. As a staunch feminist, I’m afraid to say that this game is too sexist for me to play. The character of Isaac is too sexualized, you can even see his undergarments. Its hard to believe that still in this day and age game developers are designing characters that are purposefully made to catch the male gaze. It must be because Japan has yet to experience the culturally enriching influence of thousand/hundreds of thousands of muslim immigrants in their country. Otherwise they would have know that the better option for Isaac's character instead of that naked outfit of the patriarchy he wears in the game, would have been a burka. While I’m sure the gameplay mechanics of this game are fun, I can’t help but give it a 1/10 for pandering to the cis hetro normative patriarchal gamers, and not having enough diversity and less sexualization in the game.","hours":31,"funny_percent":0.5833333333333334,"helpful_percent":0.027777777777777776}

Come on let's be honest, the first character you meet in Borderlands 2 is gay then you meet a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ called Moxxi who is bisexual, then after you meet the probably straight mechanic Scooter you meet another mechanic who is lesbian. There is also a DLC with Mr Torgue who only talks about the words badass, but himself is bisexual. Some NPCs in sanctuary have homosexual dialogue. Then when you enter Exploitation and do a quest there is a scientiest woman with a wife and a male patient with a husband. Also the guy in the Forge with the challenge arena seems to be bisexual or gay as well. You also have this lesbian in the Borderlands universe called Athena who is a lesbian too and she is a playable character in The Pre Sequal and the first character you meet in that game is a lesbian too. Oh and playable character in BL2 is bisexual too, the commando dude. Two other bisexual characters are Janey and Taffort. So my conclusion is that it's LGBT propaganda.

{"review":"Product received for free  I don't recommend this game. Don't get me wrong, the jokes are funny and Deadpool is an incredibly charming character. However, the game does have a few shortcomings. The combat system is a complete joke what with the related keys being all over the place. On top of that, attempting to bind the keys any differently are more likely to lead to frustration, so don't even think about trying to fix it.  This game's movement mechanics do not pair up nicely with the games puzzles either, leading to an incredibly infuriating experience. On a side note, there are several points in the game that take control away from the player, which always breaks the immersion. This, however, may have been an intentional design choice by the developers to poke fun at other games of similar genre and to reference Deadpool's tendency to break the fourth wall. Perhaps this is simply Poe's Law in action, and I'm actually writing a serious review of a satire game for a character built around satire.  I would rate this game a 6 out of 10. The graphics are solid and the game is well optimized, but trying to do anything besides mash buttons is an incredibly frustrating and annoying experience that I would not wish to revisit at any time in the future.  I assume that you, the developers of this game, started the introduction of Deadpool to the mainstream, so I must congratulate you there.

However, the worst thing about this game is its gameplay, and that's kind of a problem for a game, in my opinion. Certain enemies are bullet sponges who just make the game take longer without adding any challenge or fun. I didn't want to have to play the game because I wasn't having fun actually playing it, but I wanted desperately to see all of the cutscenes. Was it worth playing through it to see them? Over all, yes.   However, YouTube exists, and so do videos of the game's plot and jokes, all in order, and it's the source of about 90% or more of the game's entertainment. If you want the publisher and/or developer to have money, I suppose you could either find a way to donate themcash, or buy the game but just watch the cutscenes on Youtube. Actually playing the game just wasn't worth my time and wasn't fun, while the humor was magnificent.","hours":8.6,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.65625}

The character doesn't die. I would have felt ripped off if I had bought this at full price. I wouldn't recommend this game unless you're really into Deadpool and are bored.  Edit to add. Ok, now I've completed the game. Wow, 8 hours. This is a very basic game, no frills. Very limited destructible environments, repetitive enemies. Healing mechanic is the same as any other game.

{"review":"Just to say, I love Deadpool... The comic anyway. But this game just doesn't do it justice.   To begin with, it doesn't sync with steam cloud. If you have to uninstall for any reason prepare to start from scratch. Not a massive problem considering how short the game is.  Yes the storyline is funny, and the 4th wall breaks are funny, but the gameplay is just plain boring. The naration provided by deadpool through the gameplay gets predictable and drawn out towards the end. I think he has 2-300 lines through the game, which considering his status as 'merc with a mouth', is far too low.  Its your standard spam button melee game, with some upgrades to get combo's. The upgrade system is OK, but doesn't really add much to the game.  The major problem I have with this game is towards the end. the last few levels give up on design altogether, and just become another game that throws countless waves of increasing difficulty opponents whilst you grind away hoping that this will be the last one untill the level is over.  If you haven't got the rb + y or insta-kill upgrades then you will forever be dieing just to gain enough points to finally get the required upgrades. I spent a good 30 min repetativley trying to kill the last boss, which again is nothing but waves of enemys, just so I could upgrade to the last hammer combo (which was my main weapon in the game) and then the boss was trivial. Hitting 2-3 buttons to instakill enemys that were taking 15+ hits to kill before, and would regain health if you had to run to heal.  In short, It's an OK game, but for the franchise it should of been so much better. Hopefully now that the movie has gotten so much attention we can get a decent game that will do deadpool justice.","hours":10.8,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0}

Pros: -Deadpool and X-Men fans will appreciate the story (or lack thereof) and characters -Crude humour -Voice acting is great -Dialogue is surprisingly well written -Gameplay is fun for the first few hours  Cons: -The humour won't appeal to everybody -Deadpool's one-liners get recycled a lot -Gameplay gets stale after the first few hours -Melee combat boils down to mindlessly mashing X and Y -Not many distinct enemy variants -The final level is insanely difficult compared to the rest of the game -The story is basically non-existant (this is intentional, but it detracts from the game overall) -Very short, only takes about 6 hours to beat it. -Absolutely no replay value -Hilariously overpriced (there's no reason this game should be $40)  If you still want to buy it anyway, at least wait for a decent sale. Even at 50% off, I would still say it's pretty overpriced.","hours":5.2,"funny_percent":0.04736842105263158,"helpful_percent":0.6526315789473685}
{"review":"The does it really right. They created Deadpool as expected the jokes, the looks, the overall appaerance.   The story is pretty thin, since you could call it \"Go after that guy\".   I possibly made the mistake of playing it on the highest difficulty \"ultra-violence\". In this mode nearly every enemy can one-shot you, even if you are fully specced, with every single perk you can buy. That and the way too few autosaves made it a real pain to play through.  Additional to that I found some glitches. There were several unexpected death by projectiles that flew through walls. Sometimes I just died without seeing anything. In the final stages I had only a quater second of time to dodge the oneshot attack, right after a video sequence, which I had to watch over and over again.  And who the hell thought of this keyboard controls?   On the highest difficulty the battles were additionally really long, so the story feels really dragged throughout the game, while it is becoming thinner and thinner to the end.  After all I recommend this game only for people who either knows the marvel universe, or has fun with Deadpools repeating jokes.","hours":9.5,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.7142857142857143}

So there you go they want me to use the more common wasd to move around and I do NOT want too. I am one of those guys that's more comfortable on the arrow keys.

{"review":"The humour actually could be enough on its own to recommend this game; sadly, the mechanics are often so broken and annoying there's no fun in playing. The ideas are good, and the violence is awesome, even the Arkham style battle WITH blood is on the right track. But when there's so many enemies outside of frame that can suddenly kill you and you die in two blows on the hardest setting, it just becomes annoying. There's more enemies in Devil May Cry, but that's not a problem there, so it shouldn't be a problem here. I'm guessing the game is an ok playthrough on easy setting because it let's you soak in all the fun stuff along the way, but a game has to be rewarding, and playing though on easy isn't rewarding - I could just watch a movie in stead.  I really tried to like the game too, because Deadpool is such a fun character and I love the Arkham and Devil May Cry games. But in my tenth hour of gaming, I had enough: The same button (B) that let's you teleport/evade also blocks. That means that if you decide to evade, but there's a block \"active\" on an enemy, you will automatically block instead of evading. When evading is what you have to do because some superfat enemy is jumping at you, and you block in place instead, you're instakilled. And that's just one of the more annyoing mechanics. Also looting chests often does not work, and when there's a time limit on that, or an enemy close by, that's fatal.  I must say this though, they could actually make a good game, if they tried to play it before they released it and removed all the anooying stuff, so even if I can't recommend this game, I will/would play the sequel if it ever comes.","hours":9.7,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.46153846153846156}

{"review":"I don't see how this game has so many positive reviews.  The game is pretty, and has nice visual and sound. The first hour was fun. Initial exploration, crafting stuff, staying alive. But then what? There's no endgame I'm working towards--just seemingly endless tiers of things I can craft. I have no motivation to do so, as I'm on day 12 and I seem to be surviving just fine with grass and fire and berries and a house.   There aren't even any acheivements to unlock to drive me to try to do weird things in the game. I've crafted what I need to survive so far and I don't know where to go from here.  This would be sorta fun if not for the permadeath. It's hanging over a shadow like everything I've built. I might play some more, but when the character dies, I don't think I'll be starting again. Why would I want to go through all this initial boring build-up again, now that I've already seen it all?

It is also extremely tedious in that you have to spend way too much time repeatedly clicking to harvest enough ingredients to make anything, it is far too easy to die, and the controls are idiotic (e.g. why does changing the view 90 degrees need to be assigned two whole buttons?).

{"review":"I genuinely wanted to like Don't Starve, but the game's core mechanic of \"collect grass and twigs\" just doesn't keep me entertained.  I enjoy a good challenge, and I don't even mind the permadeath feature in survival games. By the time I finally got the hang of the Don't Starve, surviving through winter with ease and defending my camp from invaders, I had sunk 25 hours into the game. I was shocked, because I only felt like about ten percent of this playtime was fun. The rest of the time was monotonous wondering to collect the same basic supplies, and craft the same basic items, over and again. The only challenge was in playing long enough (or consulting the wiki) to figure out a winning build strategy.  The art is captivating, and I enjoyed touring the scenery during my first couple explorations of the vast open world. But this, too, became a chore on replays: I found myself dreading the start of a new game because of the prolonged exploration phase,   Although the game features caves, adventure mode, DLC, and community mods, I don't feel like replaying any more is worthwhile. Sure, there's a style to how you play this game, but there simply isn't enough variation to make my survival strategies or base designs drastically different.   I'll admit that part of my bias comes from my living situation in a rural wooded setting. I am fortunate enough to be able to collect grass and twigs in my backyard, which I can burn in my stone (well, brick) fire pit. I don't have to watch for Deerclops, but I do have plenty of wildlife and vermin that require attention. If l lived in a dorm room or in the city, then Don't Starve might be a nice substitute for a breath of fresh air.   If crafting and survival is your thing, then I highly recommend Don't Starve. But for me personally, this game lacks fulfillment and provides only a time sink.","hours":33.7,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.5}

{"review":"The game is pretty fun at first. There is only one problem. Save Game Deletion. Every time you die without first spending 10 hours collecting stuff to make an effigy your save gets deleted. This should be an option like it is with most other survival games. Most will disagree with me on this but the game is only truly hard at key points. The rest of the time is spent exploring and collecting stuff. Exploring and collecting stuff is fun at first but when you collect the same stuff for the 20th time in the same areas you collected them before it just gets frustrating to start over and do all of that over. It is annoying.   People often talk about balance but this game is not balanced at all. The deletion upon death just wasn't done right. FTL did it right because it is a short game and the whole way to the final boss is fun. This game likes to make you do remedial tasks that are only fun the first few times and when you finally do get past a tough part there is little to no reward. You never really want to build up your base because you know it will be deleted. Imagine playing Dark Souls but every time you die you have to start completely over. If you run into something hard and are not prepared you are starting over. If you are prepared it is fairly easy to overcome.  Games like this are what I call a fake challenge. They use a bunch of annoying gameplay mechanics to trick you into thinking the game is hard when in reality the only hard part is starting over when you die. Every boss or tough creature has it's weakness and once you find it winning is easy. But since you start over every time you die, finding that weakness becomes hard. Then you resort to google and find their weakness. But then you are like damn I have to do all of that nonsense before I get to try again. Guess I will just watch Netflix until I want to try again or write a crappy review about the game and remember why I quit in the first place.   I'm giving this a thumbs down because the only way to play this game without growing gray hairs is to download a mod that lets you keep your save (and they do exist).

It's compareable to the dark souls community, that if you say anything negative or point out flaws in the game you'll instantly be bombarded with insults from from diehard fans telling you things like \"you're just bad at the game\" \"this game isn't like other games you're used to\" \"this game doesn't hold your hand\" \"you just don't GET it!\" etc. while at the same time they pretty much refuse to see the flaws of the game and see the perspective of others who have a different view than them","hours":2.8,"funny_percent":0.16666666666666666,"helpful_percent":0.16666666666666666}

I wish steam had a neutral recommendation because I'd give it to this game, but it doesn't so I have to give it a negative one.  I know people are going to write some dumb \"lol ur just bad git gud lolol\" comments. The problem is I played for 2 hours and I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. The double-jumping (or triple jumping with the purple character) seemed to have some nebulous rules governing it that I simply couldn't explain. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. I played around with it trying to figure out how it works, and it seemed random to me. Apparently it just has no leniency when jumping off of ledges and my initial jumps were counting as air jumps. This is just weird design, especially for a game that emphasizes speed. I can't think of another platformer that's so strict. That leniency is necessary because characters take up a 2D space on screen. You can't just pick any point beneath Mario and say \"yeah if he hangs that far off the platform he falls\" like these devs seem to have done. I've played hard games before, including From's 3D Dot Game Heroes which was downright cruel and way harder than their Souls series', but I didn't have to google the issue and forget 20 years of game experience to \"git gud.\" If I have to google your core game mechanics, you did a poor job  The level progression is also ridiculous and keeps you from playing all of the bronze levels if you don't *perfect* all of the basic ones, so you're kinda screwed if you can't do that","hours":2.1,"funny_percent":0.08333333333333333,"helpful_percent":0.25}

{"review":"I've really tried to like this game over the past 5 or so years I've owned it. I love the concept, but I really can't say I enjoy the 'feel' of the game. It has some weird momentum-based physics that give it a sort of 'floaty' feel to it. A lot of people will call this a precision-based platformer. I would call it pretentious. The devs did well to implement a series of tutorials, as they thought the game was too hard for many. However, there are still a ton of hidden mechanics that aren't explicitly taught to the player, so it's often confusing once you've completed a certain number of levels on where to head next. Until you know what's possible in the context of the game, it's really off-putting. I shouldn't have to go to forums and YouTube to determine that there are many completely obtuse things hidden in the game's mechanics in order to proceed.   Additionally, there are numerous bugs this game has, such as the game deciding it will automatically use up your double jump if you are too close to an edge. Mr Peck on YouTube has these documented, if you want some evidence of them. Tons of optimization problems, such as crashing if you alt+tab out of the window and simply setting up a controller is a nightmare if you want to switch between keyboard and gamepad; buttons across both is frustrating. They should have just used a 'set all buttons' command and let the player sequentially determine the mappings.

Almost every level is accessable at the start, you just gather some easy taken keys and unlock all other levels. A level is completed under 1 minute. The real thing begins with doing a level over and over again until you know every jump inside out. This is a challenging task, but repeating the same thing over and over again is more like work than fun for me. Therefore I cannot recommend this game, unfortunately.

{"review":"TLDR; Supermeatboy ftw.  I have played a few more hours than shows here. Not that many more though...   I really love the idea of this game. I wish I would like it. In the end it comes down mostly to control responsiveness.  Even the simplest jumps feel hard to accomplish, movement feels jerky and if you miss a wallrun edge by a pixel the outcome is completely different and unexpected. I guess you can get used to it and \"get good\", but in this day and age there are so many games that do this right and feel natural, responsive and tight from the get-go while still having a crazy high skill ceiling. Supermeatboy: I'm looking at you and blowing a kiss.  Because of this little mistakes completely ruin your runs. Maybe it's by design, but I don't like it. I feel little mistakes should screw you a little and big mistakes screw you a lot.   Controller support exists (I play using an xbox360 controller), but it still feels funny. Some commands register on soft presses while others require full presses...  Ah and the game's pacing: While it demands big apm spikes there's more focus on precision and routing than hectic speed. So it feels weird: sluggish, complex and puzzling, kinda like that weirdly chosen soothing new age soundtrack.

{"review":"You'd think that if you liked the original, you would like the sequel, but I think it strays too far from what made Hotline Miami such a fun and addictive game in the first place.  In this game, the levels are bigger, but bigger isn't always better and the large open areas lead to a less concise, tactical feeling that the original game offered. I also don't remember quite so many guns being in the original game, as it feels like melee weapons are worthless trash that only serves to make it more difficult to pick up a new gun when you need one. In fact, many of your deaths in this game will be from trying to pick up a weapon only to find out that your character decided to pick up a useless melee weapon or empty gun instead, which feels like an incredibly cheap way to die. Since the levels are so much bigger this time around, it's all the more frustrating when you die to the last 1 or 2 enemies since that means there's just that much more to have to do all over again.  The fun of picking masks with different effects to change your strategy is pretty much completely gone. There are different masks to choose from sometimes, but only on specific characters in the multiple-character campaign, and even then the masks are more gimmicks than actual strategical advantages. For instance, the bear mask lets you start with 2 machine guns and 128 ammo. Great until you reach a point where you have 10 bullets left and you realize you're not allowed to drop the guns until all the ammo is used up and are forced to leave perfectly good guns behind because of this.  The fact that thare aren't any new features or mechanics only serves to highlight what's missing from the original, so in the end I would just suggest playing Hotline Miami 1 instead, as it's a more focused and tightly designed experience. HM2's only addition is to expand the story, which is nice and all but I loved Hotline Miami for the gameplay and the story was just an interesting bonus. Here, the gameplay suffers because the story calls for a cast of several playable characters and varying environments that simply aren't fun to play through.  Oh, also the hit detection blows. Like really really bad. I don't remember it being this bad in the first game, which is weird because I assume it's the same engine.","hours":2,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.6}
{"review":"Well how do I start... Hotline Miami was one of the most awesome indi games out there. This game isn't. Masks were an important feature in the first game, allowing different playstyles. The close quater level design suited the gameplay perfectly. The fairly low ammount of direct storytelling was good. Violence was a main element of the game. The gameplay was fast and challenging but not unfair.  So why not restrict the masks right? Or remove them for large parts completly? Or even better! Make an awesome new mask but fu*k up the controls so badly that is is basically unusable and then force the player to use it in a level? Yeah. Close quater level design to suit and emphasise melee combat? Why not include long hallways or even better: large, open spaces that pretty much force you to use your gun. The large ammount of storytelling cleared up some of the confusion from the last game but was unnecessary. Violence as a main element. Yes it kinda is. Except for one character that doesn't use leathal stuff. Great when the map is open and you can't use guns. This changed the gameplay from fast-paced to drawing enemies towards you and killing them around the corners. Challenging? Yes! Fair? No! Enemies with pinpoint accuracy and 360-degree field of view hardly seem fair.  By the time I'm writing this review I haven't finished the game but I have to say, this game is a major step down from the first part.","hours":6.8,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0}
{"review":"Pros:  -The level editor. Basically unlimited amount of levels.   -They tried. They really did. Gotta give them some credit for that. I did enjoy this game even though I give this game a thumbs down-review.   Cons:   -The level design. It's nothing like in Hotline Miami and not in a good way. Most of the levels are too big which makes them tedious and not as fun as in Hotline Miami 1. Also the glass panels. Dear God, the glass panels. They're everywhere.   -The doors. Why do they have to suck so much? How do they sometimes knock down enemies when the door doesn't even touch them? How come sometimes the enemy just gets knocked down and doesn't die if he is touching a door and you shoot the enemy with your shotgun and all of the shotgun pellets hits the enemy except one that hits the door? Why does the door have to swing constantly if you or one of the enemies is touching it? How many times do you have to fail at getting a good combo because of a door?  -The soldier/Beard/Hawaii levels. Hotline Miami 1 is one of my favourite games. That's why I bought Hotline Miami 2. I played the soldier levels and, oh boy, aren't they boring and bland. The soldier levels don't feel like they even share the same \"core\" with the levels in Hotline miami 1 or the other levels in Hotline Miami 2.   -Clunky controls. The controls feel a lot clunkier than in Hotline Miami 1. Sometimes my cursor gets \"stuck\" in the side of the screen. Sometimes the character I'm controlling turns slower than usual for some reason. I didn't have any of these problems in Hotline Miami 1.   -Lack of individual choice and combo-orientation. Remember when you had several ways of completing a level in Hotline Miami 1 and you could use different tactics with different masks? What the developers did with Hotline Miami 2 is that they took away most of the masks and you have a maximum amount of four masks to choose from in a level. There are five Fans' levels where you have four masks that are Zebra (roll dodge), Tiger (lethal punches but no weapons allowed), Swans (chainsaw and guns, fun but difficult when trying to shoot from a doorway and the swan using guns sometimes gets stuck) and Mark (two machine pistols).  There are two Jake levels, where you have three masks to choose from that are Cobra (lethal throws), Viper (silent nail gun) and Black Mamba (basically same as Tiger).  There are three Son's levels where you have three \"techniques\" to choose from that are Dirty Hands (same as Tiger), Bodyguard (roll dodge and katana) and Bloodline (same as Mark).  Out of 27 acts in Hotline Miami 2, only in 10 of those levels you can choose a mask (Son's levels included). You have 26 different masks to choose from on every stage in Hotline Miami 1 (excluding hospital level and Biker levels). As you can see, the developers considerably reduced the amount of personal choice of tactic to complete a level in Hotline Miami 2, which makes the game seem more boring to me.  Remember when in Hotline Miami 1 there were several ways to get an A+ on a level? You could be a sadistic executioner with a drill or punch everyone to death with your fists or clear the level faster than you could spell the word Miami or just get sick combos and get an A+. In Hotline Miami 2 with the reduced amount of individuality, basically the only way of getting an A+ is by getting combos. That's what I mean by combo-orientation of Hotline Miami 2. This also makes Hotline Miami 2 seem more boring to me compared to Hotline Miami 1.   -The story. The overall \"vibe\" I get from Hotline Miami 2 is very different compared to the \"vibe\" I get from Hotline Miami 1. Hotline Miami 1 had little to no story at all. One of the points of Hotline Miami 1 was that if you actually wanted to have some sort of explanation, you really had to work for it. Hotline Miami 1 wasn't about the story itself. Hotline Miami 2 really differs from Hotline Miami 1, because Hotline Miami 2 seems to really focus on the story. It feels nothing like Hotline Miami 1 and it wasn't what I really expected from Hotline Miami 2.  -The music. One of you will probably murder me for this, but I didn't think that the music was as good as in Hotline Miami 1. I think that Hotline Miami 1 has really memorable soundtrack. I don't think that the soundtrack in Hotline Miami 2 is nearly as memorable as in Hotline Miami 1. Sure there are a few great tracks, but the overall music doesn't seem to be as good as in Hotline Miami 1.   -Some minor and quite insignificant things. When you swing an enemy with an iron pipe and nothing happens for some reason./ When a guy with a shotgun runs in front of a guy running with a melee weapon and you shoot straight at the guy with the shotgun but somehow you managed to kill the guy with the melee weapon and you get shot by the guy with the shotgun./ When you have those fat guys who can be killed only with firearms and those crooks that can be killed only with melee weapons or execution at the same floor./ When you get shot by someone off screen and you have to memorize the location of this enemy./ ENDING SPOILER ./ When the character you're controlling almost never picks up the weapon you want it to pick up from a weapon pile and you're in a hurry to get a good combo./","hours":26.8,"funny_percent":0.04878048780487805,"helpful_percent":0.5853658536585366}

{"review":"I rate games on a 1-5 scale ala X-PLAY (no decimals)  There isn't much to see here. The weakest point of the original was the plot as not much is remidied. In the sequel you play as I believe 5 different characters in a completely random timeframe that both interconnect but never really intertwine leaving you more confused than ever. Nothing is really explained nor are characters stories given much context. It all ends on an acid trip of a final level that just makes you wonder why you bothered. Personally I find Hotline Miami 2 to be a big dissapointment as so much could have been improved upon. There is not much in terms of new enemies and while the expanded characters is cool it is done so poorly it is tough to care. Essentially it is just random levels that you just play to make it thruough.   The only real praise I'll give the sequel is for having some more difficult and longer levels as well as being more creative with level design but that is about it. There is nothing much new here. So unless you are a die hard fan I can't say that this is worth the 4-5 hours of your time.

{"review":"It's just not the first Hotline Miami. While it seems Dennaton understood that one of the reasons the first game was so good was the excellent soundtrack, they somehow managed to miss what made the mechanics so good. Remember that load screen tip in the original Hotline Miami that said \"recklessness is rewarded\"? Well, not in this game. The first game was all about small levels that were easy enough to study and repeat until you got to speedrunning levels, that encouraged keeping combos, using melee weapons, and generally feel like an integral badass with every floor you cleared. Hotline Miami 2 has none of that.  People complain about levels being too big, but it's more about being too long. While the first Hotline Miami had an average clear time per checkpoint of barely half a minute after repeating several times, some of the checkpoints in Hotline Miami 2 manage to be minutes long due to the vast size of the maps. This means that if a segment is supposed to be two minutes long, if you die after running for 100 seconds, you will be forced to repeat all of it again. In HM1 you would probably die on purpose several times to discover the most optimal path, but you can't afford the frustration of losing your minutes long progress in HM2 again so you end up playing defensively, which is most certainly not what made HM1 so good. Doesn't help that spotting enemies and deducing patrol patterns is more difficult due to most of them being out of sight.  There is also something very poor about HM2's writing. I know HM1 was never about the story, but the very little story it had was presented in such a way that made it feel like an insane fever dream, which contributed to the game's surreal and psychedelic aesthetic. But point is, HM1 really wasn't about story, and the game outright mocked you with the Biker ending if you thought it had. HM2 does have story, and it explains a lot of stuff that should have been left unexplained, such as .  All in all, it felt pretty bad to go from Hotline Miami to this. I expected more levels with the same playstyle as the first, and instead got... this thing. It's quite something, but at least the OST is superb, so if you are going to suffer, you may as well do with Roller Mobster playing in the background.  IMPORTANT NOTE FOR GNU/LINUX AND STEAMOS USERS: this game is bugged on its GNU/Linux release. For some reason, the AI doesn't behave quite the same as in other OSes. This is usually not noticeable, but makes beating some levels nearly impossible, as some enemies with ranged weapons supposed to be baiteable suddenly become intelligent and defend their position. I was able to beat the game in normal mode (you don't want to suffer hard mode, trust me) 100% in GNU/Linux by performing some absurd acrobatics, but it's probably not worth the effort. If you can, play Deathwish (literally impossible without intentionally tricking the AI into running out of ammo with a relatively safe but time consuming maneuver) and The Son levels (just absurdly difficult, but possible without tricking the AI) on the Windows version. If for some reason you can not play the Windows version, message me and I will try to provide some description on how to beat Deathwish on GNU/Linux difficulty.","hours":13.2,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.75}
{"review":"EDIT: I found a new issue! I tried the same level again (Casualties playing as the Soldier) I found that, for about half a second after knifing an enemy, the game won't let me switch to my gun. Absolutely brilliant. Hot garbage.  I finished HM1 and got to act 4, area 16 (Casualties) before throwing in the towel on this.  Featuring randomized enemy movement, inconsistent AI decisionmaking, and spritework that doesn't read well at the best of times (especially while the screen shifts, undulates, and muddies with neon hues,) Hotline Miami 2 (and 1 at certain times, to a lesser extent) felt like an exercise in frustration. The \"features\" listed above go in direct conflict with what it apparently wanted to be: A fast-paced action game about quick decisionmaking and lightning-fast reactions.  I can't react to enemies that aren't on the screen, have sprinted into it milliseconds ago, or blend into the background. I can't make sub-second decisions when the screen is tinted orangeish-red and I'm staring at a pile of identical bloodied corpses, waiting for one to move. I can't make reliable plans when some enemies wander randomly, doors swing around in a jittery, physics-engine-object-overlap way. I can't analyse what I did wrong, and how to improve, when I perform the same set of actions 10 times and get 10 different results.  Very few deaths felt like they were my fault, because I had no idea what I'd done wrong. Nor did any of my victories feel earned, because the optimal method of developing stategies/paths is to do the same thing a few dozen times and estimate a probability of success - and then repeating the winner of that test until I killed all the dudes.  Too much luck, too many uncontrollable variables, too many conflicting design decisions.","hours":4.6,"funny_percent":0.1,"helpful_percent":0.4}

Much of the difficulty comes from dealing enemies that shoot from outside of your character's allowed view distance, overuse of windows, and restricted weapon availability compared to the numbers and types of enemies.

{"review":"Hotline Miami 2 is/was not designed with the same concepts in mind with Hotline Miami 1. Instead there's been an expanded focus on trial and error gameplay that ruin the flow of the game.  Whereas in the first game you could get by based on twitch reaction alone and carnage along with on the spot improvisition, Hotline MIami 2 does away with that and adds many (at first) unseen kill zones where enemies have line of sight farther than yourself. This is easily mitigated by using the camera look function, but it more or less requires a break in the game flow. It becomes more about spotting and relentlessly executing the \"perfect\" method of going through a level rather than innovating on the fly with real skill and instinct. It becomes less about the ultra violence and gore and more about painstakingly doing the equivalent of a human macro. When playing new levels, it's less about experiencing it viscerally and more about playing it like a dynamically shifting puzzle.  A telling sign of bad game design is the repeated use of a \"don't do that\" or \"you must do this\" game design. Don't go down that hallway. ALWAYS shoot in this direction to kill that enemy off screen from that window. If you die, you must do these repetitive behaviors again. Now stretch that concept into *entire* levels.  Hotline Miami 1's strength was the flexibility it allowed you to tackle situations. You could plan and shoot, but no battle plan survives contact with the enemy. After that, it was down to reflexes. Hotline Miami 2's levels are not only more linear, but include even more punishing guaranteed deaths along the way that interrupt a spree. So then instead of taking the catharcism from the moment, you're back to square one; repeat the same \"don't do this/do that\" motions, but add another one on top of that list. Sure, now that you've beaten the level you know them all but that doesn't exactly reduce/stop the same repetitive nonsense over and over again. And it just gets worse with some later levels.   It's simply a vastly less enjoyable experience compared to the first. This is on top of set characters for each level, no selection of masks, some levels arbitrarily limiting your weapons and abilities because of the story, so on. The music is ace, but no one's going to actually be playing the level with Roller Mobster blaring in the background and jiving to it when they're trying to plan out exactly how to address enemies with repeated deaths over and over again.  Maybe this appeals to some people, but to me it's the devs not realizing what made HM1 fun or enjoyable.","hours":5.3,"funny_percent":0.009345794392523364,"helpful_percent":0.5794392523364486}
{"review":"Hotline Miami was a superb game. The sequel is an attempt to expand. And expand it does. However I feel it expanded in the wrong direction. The number of characters completely detracts from the game, with mask unlocks being unusable for around an hour of gameplay. While each character does play quite differently, I would have much rather had each mask drastically change the game play.  Additionally, level design felt worse this time around. There are segments where the game forces you to take certain masks, such as the new Tony mask that doesn't let you pick up weapons. While this sounds like the perfect time to create a custom level for that mask the end result is peeking in and out of cover, hoping the men with guns get aggro and run over. It isn't fun, it isn't fast. It's just tedious.  Pro: -Generally frenetic game play, and improved for the most part -The soundtrack, as always -Colorful -Large variety in gameplay  Con: -Masks restricted to characters, who are in turn restricted to levels -Doors still clip into the character, causing throwing to fail a large amount of the time -Enemies have a tendency to stand inside each other  Neutral: -Vastly expanded story over the first -There was something else, but I forgot what it was.","hours":2.7,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0}

There is this rebellic punk girl who doesn't like her stepfather. The chearleader that was pregnant from a footballer and had to abort. The girl that gets bullied and wanted to kill herself. And the typical rich ♥♥♥♥♥ who doesn't like you. They tried to put some substance behind the personalities: For example the rich ♥♥♥♥♥ is just so nasty because she's insecure - it was still boring. I really wished they would have had some better authors or psychologists who know more about creating complex characters.  The main character: She is so insecure and shy and has no self-confidence but she is famous for her selfies? WTF? Am I the only one noticing this big logical mistake? And then she calls herself a photo nerd but uses an instant camera? Isn't the substance of real photography knowing how to use all the filters, using different settings with the diaphragm and changing objective lens? My opinion is that the main character was created for little teenager girls so that they can identify with her. But looking behind the facade at least I noticed that the creation is fake, selfish, boring and irritating. Absolutely no chance one can identify with her.  The story: As the character creation is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the story was, too. The dialogues were so long and boring. The story was so predictable. The only scene when I felt something was at the end of episode 3 but actually the idea was stolen from the movie \"Butterfly effect\" with Ashton Kutcher. The first two episodes were unnecessary and could have been comprimed to one episode. Searching for bottles at a scrapyard so that your stupid - oh sorry, I mean \"rebellic\" - friend can shoot on them was absolutey no fun.

{"review":"I'm a big fan of adventure games, and I really, REALLY wanted to like this one. But I'm sorry, I just can't, because Life is Strange was quite possibily one of the most unenjoyable gaming expearinces I have had in a long time. Lets go through everything.    Gameplay: *Laughs uncontrobaly* What gameplay? I understand that this is a story focused game, but that doesn't mean that the actual gameplay sections have to be completly dull, lifeless, and tedious. Almost all of the \"puzzles\" are simply gathering various items, and bringing them back to one location/character. Non of them require ANY amount of actual analytical thinking, which is the kind of thing I expect from this genre. I was hoping that there would be some parts where the time manipulation mechanic could be used in puzzles, and while there are a couple, there are aren't enough to keep anything interesting or add any variety.  Technical: The graphics in Life is Strange are stylized, which is fine, but it begs the question, why? There doesn't seem to be any real need to have graphics stylized. If Max was, say, an illustrator, it would make sense, because then everything looks like a drawing. But she is a photographer, so shouldn't things look realistic then. Honestly I feel the real reason for this was to make it easier to hide some fairly bad textures. While the character models look great, if you look closely at some of the walls, floors, and Frank's hat, it looks pretty fuzzy. The voice acting is extremly solid, espeacially from Ashly Burch, and there was really only one voice actor who left anything to be desired. Unfortunatly, it was the person who mattered the most; Max. She uses the exact same tone of voice throughout the ENTIRE game, no matter what is happening. Also, as a side note, the lip synching in this game is dreadful.   Story: Games like this live and die by their story, and unfortunatly, this game is dead on arrival. Not to say that the concept and ideas in the story are great. The time travel thing was cool, and a quiet town hiding dark secrets gives off a Twin Peaks vibe. Unfortunatly, that is not where most of the plot is focused. Because a majority of the plot is centered around the relationship between Max, and quite possibily the most unlikable personI have ever seen in a work of fiction. For the first three straight episodes, I did not see ONE reason why I should like Chloe Price. She is rude, selfish, and shows very little gratitude for any of the good Max does for her. She did get nicer come episode 4, but it never felt like there was any character development leading to that, it felt more like \"Oh hey, I'm suddenly nice now, and I'm going to apologize for all the♥♥♥♥♥♥I put you through\". However, my biggest problem with her is that despite being an absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game insists that I am wrong for disliking her. Everytime I am given a choice of agreeing with her or not (I agreed with her a grand total of one time), the game chastizes me, and says I am wrong for doing so. instead of letting me form my own opinion, the game tells me that this one opinion is right and I am wrong for having the other. ♥♥♥♥. You.  Score: 4/10","hours":11,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.5714285714285714}

{"review":"Life is Strange is poorly animated, has childishly simple and yet still unintuitive controls, and the gameplay is almost nonexistent. And yet, through all these faults I loved the game all the way through the first four chapters.  Unfortunately, the game suffers from the awful Mass Effect 3 Syndrome, in which a game that purports to be about small individual choices comes down to one big choice in the end that completely wipes out any other choices you may have made. In a short game, this is a fatal flaw.  And it's not just the ending - the entire last chapter is a complete departure from the earlier chapters. Chapter 1 and 2 are about high school drama, Chapter 3 and 4 are an investigation into a mystery disappearance. Those are great. Chapter 5 is a psychological/supernatural head trip in which nothing is explained or investigated and must be taken on face value (the opposite of what the other 4 chapters tried to teach you).  This would have been a great game if they'd completely gotten rid of the tornado sub-plot, taken out the nightmare scene at the end, and tied things up neatly with an ending that shows you all the consequences of your other actions, and maybe has some small choices in the beginning turn out to be very important in the end.  I wish I could recommend getting invested in this game, but I felt so betrayed by the final chapter that I cannot.","hours":16.2,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.46153846153846156}

My main problem is with main mystery left unanswered considering everything in game is caused by it.  Game has its moments and lot of stuff done right. But my greatest disappointment is considering questions asked in this game, and majority of them left unanswered. Very nice mystery imposed, with solid pacing throughout game, but that could be better. Lot of time dedicated to trivial stuff even after, for example 2nd and 3rd episode, where you should start getting some answers!  Big questions about main character are not answered even after complete season! They can not expect to spoon-feed us couple of more filler seasons to get even basic answers.  Good basis for game set, but unfortunately potential is not used very well, or is gated behind seasons to come.

I'm not even gonna start on the plot holes. You're better off reading a Sue Grafton novel.  Life is Strange is the interactive equivalent of Twilight, a vapid shell of a \"game\" tacked onto an uninspired story of teenage drama, with an element of supernatural thrown in for... no good reason whatsoever.

{"review":"After all the acclaim this game has received, one would think this would be a good game about time travel, right? No.  Both in gameplay and story it misses all the marks and potential that the genre would give it - and that's precisely why it was so successful. It caters to the lowest common denominator. The story is a trope ridden mess (the setting even mostly revolves around a high school). The characters are trying very hard to be relatable, but only manage to come off as pretentious.  There isn't much gameplay at all - the gameplay loop consists of watching a cut scene - trying to find whichever object or character that is necessary to progress the scene and repeat ad nauseum. Sometimes there are \"puzzles\" - which are usually disgustingly simple with the odd 1 or 2 that have an overly specific solution that make them nearly impossibly hard as a result.  The time rewinding mechanic like the time travel does nothing particularly new or exciting with the concept and thus ends up being nothing more than a pointless gimmick.  This review wouldn't be so scathing if there wasn't a moment or two of brilliance that make me believe that this game could have been so much more than what it ended up as.  The weak gameplay could be overlooked since this is a narrative-focused game - but the narrative is also so weak that the game can't save itself from the mediocrity that comes from watering down an interesting concept to maximize its potential audience.","hours":19,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.4878048780487805}

The best strategy I've found involves sprinting through each level to the teleporter and cheesing the following fight as hard as you can to win. This leads to the unfulfilling gameplay loop of \"Did I get anything good, did I get close teleporters to the spawns, and did I get easy bosses in the first 2 stages? If not, you're going to get 1 shot by something on the third level, restart.\"  I tried setting it down to Drizzle (easy) and the game became TOO easy. While I was now able to fight things and buy everything I wanted, there's no interesting item combinations since you eventually collect everything, and none of them interact in interesting ways.

I am on Linux and about one in every four games I play ends in a crash. I have scoured the internet, tried dozens of fixes, and I still get errors about missing Game Objects. This happens across two different computers running Ubuntu, and even on my windows machine the game has crashed on me a few times. The final straw is the fact that I cannot even unlock the miner because the game crashes every time the boss to unlock him spawns.  A few small things that would at least help mitigate the worst of the trouble would be making cloud saving a thing, and also making it so when you unlock something the unlock is instantly recorded into your save file, not at the end of the run. I don't know if this would be enough to make me want to play again but it would be a major step in the right direction.

{"review":"I played this game at launch and recently got back into it. The game looks fantastic and the soundtrack is stellar.  The problem, however, is that the game is ludicrously unbalanced in almost every aspect of combat. The only way to survive here is to be constantly running away from enemies and turn around to fire one shot at them, then run away again. This is boring as♥♥♥♥♥♥and most enemies can even run as fast as you can, meaning there isn't a single point where you can reliably get a hit on enemies. Melee characters are objectively worse than ranged ones because of this.  Having infintely respawning enemies once you activate the boss is one of the worst design decisions I've ever seen. You're told to run away until time runs out, but there's two problems with this. One, it means you have to constantly dodge the boss for 90 seconds while ensuring you get no progress since enemies respawn infinitely and there's no opportunity to attack the boss. This is a pointless time waste as far as I'm concerned. Two, once the smoke clears and the boss is dead, the remaining enemies are sometimes clumped into a swarm on one platform. I legitimately don't understand what the developers expect you to do in that situation. If you're a melee character, you have to restart. If you have a ranged attack, you literally either have to jump onto the platform, fire once, and jump out lest you get overrun immediately, or you have to exploit the enemies' inability to move from the platform and just shoot from safety. This doesn't work on later stages, though, since you'll have an absurd amount of enemies that can teleport and fly while you're stuck running away forever until you die from getting hit from nowhere.  The only way to get past this is by getting lucky on some trinket spawns. Some of these make you so overpowered that the game turns into \"quit when you get bored\" instead of the normal \"quit because you can't even attack things\".

Let's put aside the horrible controller configuration if you're playing with an xbox controller (now I have the Steam Controller and it solves perfectly this problem). What I can't tolerate is the fact that the game crashes. A lot. In different computers. Even after reinstalling the game. I've read about this bugs since 2014, I've suffered in 2015 and now, in 2017, it still crashes.  I bought a 4-pack and some friends were able to play it with relatively no problem (controller configs, hosting games, etc), so I never even tried to ask for a refund.  So yeah, from what I've been able to play this is a cool game, I guess if it worked perfectly it would be a great game, but if there's no guarantee that you can play for more than 10 minutes without any random crash I can't recommend this game ever, and that's a shame.","hours":2.2,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.2}

The reason they recommend the controller is beacause you can blame the unresponsive analogue stick for the latency between command input and command execution. A keyboard feels infuriating to use because it feels like you are lagging in an offline mode and I will not compensate for the lag by using an analogue stick that instead of mitigating the laggy controls only makes them harder to notice as you think the controller is at fault rather than the game. I cannot play a platformer with unresponsive movement it is like trying to jerk off with sand paper. Thats probably why only 5 percent of the player base even bothered completing the game. If they ever make a sequel I will gladly buy it provided it has responsive movement.","hours":1.9,"funny_percent":0.13043478260869565,"helpful_percent":0.34782608695652173}

{"review":"I could give a positive review for this game. But I won't.  This game is very good at what it is: hardcore platformer for those ppl who love such games. Most (but not all) levels designed very good.  Below are reasons why this review is negative and why I wouldn't recommend to play this game just to save your nerves: 1. Characters are almost uncontrollable. Somebody could said this game has perfect controls. BUT NO. This game in most cases is so fu**ng hard just because you cannot control precisely your character in certain cases. Authors made main character to accelerate its speed extremely fast. In addition to sliding after loosing acceleration you getting uncontrollable peace of♥♥♥♥♥♥ not a meat. 2. Balancing in the air isn't possible in most circumstances. Especially when you need to do things fast. This is also due to imbalanced acceleration. 3. Randomness of this game in some levels is third annoying thing. For example, evading rockets and black flying monsters that are split onto 8 little monsters and fly in radial directions. You almost cannot predict their behavior and how to avoid them. It is awful in hardcore game when you cannot control the process. 4. Game crashes. Yeah, such a simple game crashes everytime after locking Windows 10 screen. And this could not be a big problem - levels are short and you pass them immediately or repeat. Except one! Last level in \"The End\" chapter when you escape from boss, and then after reaching the end of level you appear in next zone. And this zone isn't available from level list screen. So, if you quit, you need to pass first part of final boss again! 5. REFUSE TO JUMP. In some cases you may fill that your character won't jump when it MUST. This is happens after colliding with any ground. If you press just nanosecond earlier, the character will not jump. Also, if you accelerate on the platform and try to jump at the end, it could not jump and drop down. It was a last drop (after failing Cotton Valley 20 level on Dark World on the LAST saw just because this b**ch refused to jump) after I really decided to write this review.  Anyway, despite of this, I still playing this game, and if you do not afraid of all bad things described above, then I would recommend it to play.","hours":95.8,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0}

{"review":"The term impossible shouldn't be used lightly.  There's no skill involved, It's multiple attempts to pass a level, until eventually you work out the levels pattern and it's environment. While doing so you're performing luck-based jumps, and wall-grinding movements, and dodgy arcs in the air to land on a small platform, avoiding monsters and swinging axes,  Until finally you finish the level and get to see a final recap of your 100 Meatboy attempts all dying along the way while following the one that makes it to the end. It seems this final recap is proving after all those attempts you've accomplished something, but I'd rather have fun playing another game than 'not enjoy' something and force myself to complete it.  You'll be dying every 10seconds, and if you're not up for a lot of resets-repeats-defeats, then you'll not enjoy this Game.  I've tried to play it 4 times in the past because it's a positive and successful game but each time in doing so I find myself shutting the game down, annoyed and rewriting my review.

Sans is the charcter i hate the most. everybody wants his d*ck even though hes a f*cking skeleton, his humor is extermelly terrible and makes no sense, of course all these undertale fans is gonna dislike this because im taking the sh*t out of a game. i didn't find the RPG aspect fun either, it just felt like i was doing a chore. papyrus was a terrible charcter and was not funny. the way he acted was very kiddish and doesn't display a fun attitude. toriel is just at the start to expand the beggining of the game and is a terrible charcter. ever since sans spilled the beans about toriel and him chatting telling stupid puns everyone drew p*rn of them. frisk is just like the doom main character, has no personality and never talks. and chara and asriel. chara has nothing to do with the story whatso ever. asriel doesn't either, they're just there to make the story \"Better\". flowey is the only bad guy in the game, and does the worst out of it. even bowser does a better job. alphys is just a otaku charcter to be like all these anime fans. undyne is oblivous and thinks that anime is real. nothing about this game made me laugh. and the \"Puzzles\" were all extermely easy. just completing this game felt like a chore and i hated it. this also has no realism whatso ever, through all of this fnaf is a better game. and you may say \"BUT IT WAS MADE BY ONE PERSON@!!!\".Toby fox could've done a better game. and did nothing to stop this garbage community. the p*rn always has something to do with sans. like hes saying \"LOL XD\" in the background or getting his d*ck sucked. he has nothing to do with this but everyone loves him. and so i give this game a 1/10 for being terrible. one of the worst games in 2015.","hours":22.6,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.2727272727272727}

You feel forced into a pacifist’s playstyle, and then must go through the game trying to please people using no logical basis for what you do other than not attack. Certain items, weird music, and other plot points can cause any number of weird, largely confusing things to happen. It’s just not fun. You can spend an exorbitant amount of time learning these tricks, constantly google on the Undertale wiki what to do, or go through the game frustrated like I did because, no matter what you do, you’ll never know what to do for any new situation as the pacification methods are different for each monster, boss, or situational ordeal.  Either destroy everyone throughout the game and get the genocide ending, or don’t play. It’s not worth the ragefest that is having to go through each situation, figure out what you’re supposed to do (usually causing at least one restart), and then load your game, sometimes several steps behind with many minutes lost, to progress.

{"review":"Do you know why I hate Undertale?   Because it's the best game ever made.  The graphics look like they were drawn by a 4 year old, with the talents of Pablo Picasso, in his prime.  Which is what I would have said, if I liked the graphics.   Which I do.   Not.  Narratively, this game is a paragon of interactive storytelling; every choice you make weighs on your conscious, because the connections you make with the characters feel organic.

{"review":"So, this is just a quick practical review of what I think about Undertale. I think this game is severely hit and miss. While the game was never unenjoyable to me, in fact, I have been quite enjoying the overall feel and cheekiness of it when I have been trying to play. But the game never hooked it me. The first time I tried it, I played to the end of the snowy town, took a break once I had gotten into the cave and just... never came back to it. I tried again yesterday and, once again, it hasn't been clicking, in fact, this time it didn't click even sooner and the humor had pretty much been drained out of experiencing everything all over again and I was laying down, half asleep, and playing it with one hand before I finally gave it a break.  I'm giving this a \"no\" if only for the lack of a \"I 'unno\"; it does what it wants to well, but for me, to other people who may be like myself, I want to say... no. It is a game that is enjoyable in all aspects of actually playing it to me, but it never gave me a reason to come back to it. Comparing it to games I have been playing recently, it seems like it has a case of wanderlust, or at least, wants to inspire you with one. The save menu jokes actually seem rather potent at this moment because, as a joke, they never gave a reasonable reason to be determined, but yet, at the same time, the actual game in itself gives you no reason to be determined.   Going over the games I have been playing lately, they all have given me something to drive for. Warframe, the gameplay, for the most part, is the main reason to play, but the story-lines are compelling to follow, either because they are well-written and enthralling, or it is intriguing to see what is at the end of the path. Hammerwatch, with its gameplay quite reminescient of a much older game, Gauntlet, is all about finding your way through an unforgiving and deadly dungeon, to see what comes next as you progress deeper through your setting. Fallout: New Vegas puts you as a man left for dead with no memories left after a bullet drilled through your brains, and gives you a dozen different ways to make your own path, with each of them as fleshed out and compelling as the next, whether it is affirming the dominance of either of the two main factions, or merely finding out what happened to you and setting out to aid the other people of the wasteland. Devils Daggers doesn't have much a story, but every moment is a chapter in a horror story, deep, and dark, and perverse, a fight for survival against unearthly, lovecraftian foes who chuckle at your demise and crawl across your senses with the skittering of a million insects and the hollow thunk of hollow bones; every second longer lasted is not only a prolongment of survival, but a new chapter in a terrifically horrific tome sealed with the finality and silence of death.  Undertale? Well, it positions you as a lost human, who needs to find their way back home. The problem? \"Home\" is never developed. For the ruins, it gives you a reason why it is not a good home, despite being inhabited with a strong motherly figure. It's small, it's boring, and it's no way for a child to live. However, the next area is anything but. It has characters of warmth and passion, it has size and depth, and it feels tenfold more alive than the ruins did. Apparently, someone is gonna want us dead, and we really gots to stop 'em... but they're never developed beyond text. As much as it tells you to be determined to go on, as soon as I had completed all that I could in that snowy, little village, it seemed as though I had found anything that could be wanted for a home for my character, and I was done.

{"review":"I wouldn't say this is a terrible game, but I am extremely underwhelmed by it given how popular it is. The writing is good, but the gameplay isn't fun, and no matter how interesting a story is I need to at least enjoy playing the game. A choose your own adventure comic would have been a better format to tell this story, because the \"gameplay\" is almost nonexistant. The puzzles are too simple and the combat is just dodging projectiles for a couple seconds. This is also a really bad game to play if you have carpel tunnel because of all the button pressing you have to do to get through lengthy monologues in very small dialog boxes.  Pros: + Good story + Funny if you like goofy humor + I guess replayability is a pro but I can't bring myself to finish the first game, so I don't think I'll be seeking alternate endings  Cons - Bad level design: you spend way to much time pressing the walk key to traverse long hallways and bridges that serve no purpose - Combat is obnoxious  - Puzzles are not challenging","hours":6.3,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.46153846153846156}

I am sincerely curious).  I knew virtually nothing of UNDERTALE aside from the fact that is had been unexpectedly wildly popular, that is was an unconventional RPG \"with feelings\" and that it looked \"retro\" (and we can probably agree on the ugly side of retro).  So I bought the game, played it until shortly after meeting Toriel, after a few simple fights and solving two puzzles, and I immediately lost interest. I know many would say that I should be more patient and give it more time, but I subscribe to the school of thought that a story - be it a book, film or game - should have a strong opening but instead Undertale greeted me with a dull tutorial, ugly graphics, lame grinding, lamer puzzles and the flattest storytelling.  I watched reviews that praised the humour, the characters and the story, I read the plot on Wikipedia and honestly I don't see anything that makes me want to play this game.

{"review":"Very boring. I used to like this game, but I definitely overhyped it, because it's boring and a lot of the characters are pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sans is definitely the worst character, he's not funny and people like him just because hes edgy. The writing isn't bad, I'll give it that, it's actually pretty good, but the gameplay is just awful. The music is good, but I can't hear it the same way again ever since the fandom decided to go to absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's like FNaF, but I don't hate FNaF as much as I do Undertale. Undertale just makes me angry in a sort of way I can't explain. FNaF is a boring game, but the fandom didn't do anything to it for me. Seriously, this game makes me angry, and it's probably the only game I've played that has done that. Also, the fanbase is SO sensitive you literally can't have an opinion against this game being good without somebody telling you you're wrong. The Pacifist run is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, because it has nearly the same ending as every other one and you need to go on dates and help them with their personal problems with everybody to get the \"true\" ending?

{"review":"*WARNING* Here comes an unpopular opinion.    I don't like the game, but before you bash me with the hate train which goes \"Chu chu chu!\" with dislikes, hear me out. I didn't understand the hype before playing the game (and I will probably never do), but I decided to give the game atleast a chance since I've bashed the game for a long time without actually playing it. So why did I suddenly test it then? Well I started thinking about the quote \"At least give it a shot/chance.\" and that is the reason I tried playing the game. I also read reviews like Mcgooky's review   Originally posted by Mcgooky:  1. Ignore the cancer fanbase 2. Buy this game 3. Understand why everyone is crazy about this game.   What I'm going to get bashed for:  I didn't put enough time into the game I don't understand the details of the game/games when it comes to: 1. Graphics 2. Storyline   MY answer:  \"I didn't put enough time into the game\"   *Sure, I can somewhat agree to this one. I probably never gave the game the time the game needs, since I've heard that you need to play atleast 10 hours before you find the enjoyment/understand the details of the game. But here are the problems in MY opinion.   1. The biggest problem with this game is how am I suppose to play the game if the game is not interesting from the start. If I want to quit the first minute I start the game how am I going too last 10 hours to then hopfully understand the game. The game probably has one of the best endings ever, which it seems like by the reviews and I can't take that away, since I won't know the ending/endings for now atleast since I'm not playing the game. If I would for an example read a book and I find the first chapter of the book boring how am I supposed to be atracted to continue reading? The answer is: I won't. Which I feel like is the same thing with playing this game.   If we make another example with a game which seems to be completely opposite to Undertale is the game Firewatch (when it comes to endings and the start of the game). Damn I've never been so emotionell at the start of a game. I had tears which ran down my cheek maximum of 10 minutes into the game. Now, I think I've never seen a worse ending of a game when it comes to Firewatch, since the game showed so much potenial and a game that stunning to drop to absolute garbage of an ending. But I guess undertale is the opposite of Firewatch, A game that is complete garbage at the start (Sorry not sorry) which then goes to being the most wonderful game ever.   2. I can barley stand to play this game because of the graphics. It is a 8-bit game, nothing wrong with it being 8-bit there are plenty of 8-bit games out there which looks nice, but this one looks like it has been drawn by a 8 year old. What do I mean by this is that I can't see the \"details\" of the graphics when the graphics are poorly drawn.   3. Storyline, I didn't feel the connection like other people do, but it might be like my first point, I need to put more time into the game. I also don't get how you can be so emotionally active with a \"reading dialogue\".    LAST WORDS  Have I given up on the game?   When I started to write this review the answer was Yes. But when I'm almost done with writing this review I realised something when i reflected on Firewatch and that is that I've played Undertale for about 30 minutes and I feel very unattracted for playing this game, but I think I might be more interested when I finally push through and play these 10 hours and I get this great ending. But I have to take that step and I'm not hyped/ready on doing it.   So will I give Undertale another chance?   Yes, sometime in the future, since I saw other reviews saying that they gave up on the game at first but then played it and enjoyed it.   Will this review get bashed by dislikes?   The answer is probably yes, sadly.   Will I change the review to postive if I manage to enjoy the game?   Yes, Of course.  IF you have any more concerns on how I \"ruin\" this game review score, Or if you want me to kill myself/death threat me because I put a negative review on your favorite game, add me or write a comment.    -Unpopular opinion guy out.","hours":0.4,"funny_percent":0.1,"helpful_percent":0.5}

Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the game quite a bit and adored the soundtrack. Overall, it is a decent game, just boring after a while and quite short, beatable within 4 hours.

The worst aspect of this game is its community of weak-minded fans. Of course, such communities have become common in today's sad state of gaming culture. Even the creator of Undertale expressed regret concerning the unfortunate community that has appeared around it. However, I think he's mostly to blame for this state of affairs considering the amount of anime and weeb influence he brought into his creation.
