Story is about an octopus, which is Octodad(Player) living life with her wife(Scarlet) and two kids named Tommy(son) and Stacy(daughter). Being an octopus isn't easy, because there is this person, a chef(Fujimoto) that wants to turn you into moderately priced sushies. You know like those 10 sushies stacked and sold for $2.99 per plate.  Game is simple, you play as Octodad. Then you begin your adventure.  Game is fun and the controls are great with cool story! A very fun destruction game with fun story and seriously good soundtracks and graphics.Very recommended for singleplayer or co-op, if you would like to play with your friends and pals, this game is very suitable. Really good game if you want some big laugh.  You would never find any more foolish games in Steam.This game is the most unique game ever made...You SHOULD try it out, even for $14.99.

Yes, it's also funny for kids. Yes, the story is far fetched. Yes, the music is cool. Yes, it's not too easy but also not too hard. Yes, it's many hours of hilarious fun. Yes, the physics are good.  But you know what? The control of Octodad is a blast! YOu have 2 control modes which you switch with the middle mouse button. One is walking ... sometimes sliding ... by pressing left/right mouse for the left/right leg ... erm ... arm. The other mode is just for controling your right arm ... errr ... just another arm. While in control of your legs/arm, you move the mouse to stear it in the 3D room. The controls are really intuitive after you get used to it. Much easier than e.g. in Surgeon SImulator 2013.  Octodad is always in motion - well, it's not that easy to \"stay\" on 4 arms to somehow hide your appearance in a human trouser. It's a little slimy, slippery and jelly like movement. You can grab/hold things by usiong your vaccuum arm. The arms are also quite elastic and can stretch about twice it's size when holding unmovable things. You can also throw obstacles around. You also swim totally nacked just like a real octopus in the water. And have to solve lots of puzzles and quests.  I bought this game for my children, but it's so much fun, that I had to play it, too. If you like to have a good time - palay Octodad! :-)","hours":13.3}

With fun and goofy controls to control Octodad's tentacles to get by without anyone knowing is definitely great fun, and mixed with a fun storyline with some great dialog, it was a real treat to play.

He wears a stylin' suit. He's Octodad! The player will control Octodad as he goes about his \"normal\" life, undertaking seemingly mundane tasks for his family.   Its sounds very simple, but the controls....the controls make it a huge challenge. And that's where this game shines! The controls make for some hilarious moments, and that's what this game is all about. It's not meant to be serious, but more of a fun, relaxing adventure full of laughs and mishaps. It has a very lighthearted story, and you come to love the brave, fatherly octopus. Don't ask how he had 2 human children though...  The controls are...well, atrocious. You use the mouse to manipulate his arms and legs. Pressing Spacebar toggles between moving your arms or legs. You press and hold the right mouse button and move the mouse in the direction you want the arm/leg to move. It sounds easier than it really is because the mouse is very sensitive, so a slight move will send his arms/legs everywhere, toppling everything nearby over! Be careful how much commotion you cause, as a bar across the bottom of the screen fills up when you are nearby any people and they see you knocking stuff over. When the bar is full, that's it! Your disguise is blown, and you restart from your last checkpoint. After a little while the player should get used to the sensitivity of the mouse and be able to complete most tasks in a relatively short time...just expect several tries as you go!  If you liked and enjoyed games such as Surgeon Simulator 2013, Probably Archery, or even Ampu-Tea, you owe it to yourself to give Octodad: Dadliest Catch a try. The antics you will get into is well worth the pricetag.  Recommended! ","hours":6.1}
{"funny_percent":0.0007097232079489,"helpful_percent":0.9048781503314921,"review":"I feel like it's rare to find a video game that's funny. Not the kind of \"funny\" that Borderlands 2 tried to be, where the development team ham-fistedly shoved in as many internet memes and pop culture references as possible, devoid of any meaningful context. I'm also not talking about an ostentatious satire of modern Polish political dealings (though if you find one of those, let me know immediately). No, the kind of funny I'm talking about is just chaotic, goofball, slapstick comedy. Not a biting social commentary, no gritty world, and no over-abundance of the color brown. It makes you laugh because it's just straight-up silly.  It's no surprise, then, that I adore Octodad: Dadliest Catch (what a great subtitle, by the way). Developed by a team of college students, the original Octodad was a humorous concept but something of a technical mess. That's okay, because it was just a school project that they decided to release to the world. Dadliest Catch is the full realization of the inherently comedic ideas: You're an octopus moonlighting as a human man, trying to hide from your human family the fact that you are an octopus. You go about mundane, inconspicuous human activites such as mowing the lawn, making coffee, and grilling hamburgers with the kind of stunning precision one would expect from an octopus. If you're not already sold, then I don't know what to tell you.   The controls are loose and imprecise in a way that really feels like you're trying to control a bipedal octopus-man, but they're also consistant in a way that keeps the player from feeling any lack of agency over Octodad's actions. The ragdoll physics of Octodad's body only serve to add a level of awkwardness to everything you're trying to do. Within the first five minutes of gameplay, I accidentally found myself completely wrapped around a floor lamp, writhing on the floor like an octopus wrapped about a lamp. I tried to think of a better analogy, but I'm pretty sure you can imagine that situation. I was also laughing hysterically at the ridiculous situation Octodad had gotten himself into.  Technicallly, this game is pretty impressive. It's very well optimised, with a consistantly high framerate on my admittedly below-average PC. The art style is cartoony and clean, and all of the colors pop like a Technicolor movie. It's a world totally suited to Octodad's wacky hijinks. The non-octopus characters are a pleasant surprise as well: they're caricatures of some modern personality tropes such as the overly cynical journalist or the too-smart-for-her-age daughter. One character I particularly enjoyed was the chef, but I'll refrain from spoiling those moments here.  Now, normally I dislike reference-based humor. I feel like it's never done well, because it's just shoved in your face as if to say, \"Look as this! We know about that thing you know about! Aren't we timely/clever? LOOK AT OUR RELEVANCE!\" Octodad: Dadliest Catch makes some pretty direct references to other indie games. For example, in the supermarket level, there's a table at the back with a breakfast cereal that is a Minecraft reference. It's not right in your face, and you might even miss it if you look too fast. If you go up and try to grab the block modeled after Minecraft's Creeper enemies, it'll briefly flash and then explode in a small cloud of smoke. It's not subtle, per se, but it's not trying to rub its relevance in your face. I really appreciate that quality, and the entire game is sprinkled with similar little touches like that.  Octodad: Dadliest Catch has been in the spotlight since its huge appearance on stage at the PlayStation 4 conference at E3 2013. Since then, the hype has been steadily growing, all culminating in a final release which absolutely delivers on everything I ever wanted Octodad to be. Young Horses makes an incredible debut with a technically solid, gut-bustingly funny video game. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with Octodad: Dadliest Catch, and I can't wait to see what's next.","hours":4.6}

The story is great because it is so simple. Who knew outside the world of menial task simulators would you find yourself having fun in a game where you go to the supermarket or mow the lawn? Despite having the ability to take full control of your character, as you learn the ropes of the controls you find a complete unpredictability with how you're going to find yourself next, and it's hilarious. In fact because of the strange and unique way you control the character, I found a sense of achievement when I managed to complete something, then had to laugh at myself for feeling that sense of achievement because I managed to get my character out of a door properly.   The graphics are lovely and of a very nice quality, it's definitely a nice game to look at. It's simple but cartoony. It performs great and feels well optimized.

{"funny_percent":0.38461538461538464,"helpful_percent":0.7023409940511904,"review":"Octodad: Dadliest Catch, a title that manages to embody the strangeness of its charm as well as its niche appeal of an audience that enjoys the slapstick, dad-joke comedy of an octopus trying to be a father. That description alone should inform anyone whether they think the game is right for them, but the bigger question that comes to mind is how does a critic judge a game like Octodad? Can a game like Octodad even be criticized without missing the purpose behind its absurdity?   If the premise alone did not capture you, then the control scheme may allure you with its obtuseness; Octodad does not have great gameplay or great game-feel, yet the comedy is driven by how the player is awkwardly moving through average-day scenarios that create tension with the controls and how they are a struggle. In many ways, the weird audiences that enjoy the wonky physics-platformers of games like QWOP may find more entertainment value here than other people. However, one thought constantly nags at me is how it would be easy to lump Octodad with the many YouTuber-bait games like Surgeon Simulator or Jazzpunk that I ultimately will never understand their appeal, yet there is something here that has always beguiled me to replay it many times just to watch the seeming futility of a spineless man make his family proud against the odds of the player mastering the controls.   You Can Blub the Blub, But Can You Walk the Walk?  Awkward control schemes have gone the way of the Cephalopod as standardized controls are the accepted norm for games regardless of genre, especially in the 3D landscape. This is mainly due to consumer expectations over time that have weeded out games with deviations in control-schemes through series adapting with the times for profits like Metal Gear Solid or games that never lived long enough to challenge the standards of the audiences like the many platformers of the ‘90s. Reiteration of these successful control schemes has solidified them that whenever a game attempts, and mainly fails, to innovative for the better we end up with situations like the dual-screen play for Star Fox Zero.  Octodad is nowhere near as frustrating as the situation with Star Fox Zero but the same problem arises by how it has managed to create a control-scheme that is so awkward it makes the act of walking towards the next objective a reward in of itself. Controls, on a gamepad by yourself, are best described much like QWOP in how buttons control the individual parts of Octodad where the triggers control the left and right legs that the left thumbstick can move in a general direction. When not in motion, the right analog stick can move one arm that can be used to latch on to a ledge, and when using the legs in tandem with the one arm the player is able to scale obstacles with enough practice to make climbing possible while accounting for depth perception and for orientation of Octodad. Everything else about the game is focused around finding objects, bringing them towards another place and/or using them to clear out another objective. These include simply fetching grocery items, beating a kid at table hockey, and using a prize grabber machine with a claw or a tentacle through the prize window.  Perhaps what is largely responsible for why the system is more endearing than frustrating is because the tasks you complete are broken up into clear objectives with small steps based on the level-design itself where movement is the only challenge to create a solution. As far as the game’s sense of challenge, Octodad has to remain as inconspicuous as possible by not knocking things over and doing things as normal as possible like any other dad. There is a certain amount of skill involved in utilizing Octodad’s physics in a proper way to overcome obstacles with ease, but it mainly encourages an awkward means of solving the most basic of tasks. Even when the game allows for four-player cooperation, which can have an Octopus Roulette mode that changes each player’s arm, the game is still structured around the simple appeal of ushering an octopus down the aisle to marry his wife as well as evade the exploits of a mad sushi chef seeking to undo his identity.   Come to the Dad Side, We Have Bad Jokes  Similar to how Costume Quest has become my traditional Halloween game every year Octodad has become what I would think of as a Father’s Day game that could be perfect with the whole family for a group activity to celebrate the day. This isn’t because the game is based around the holiday but the storyline and comedy works along with the gameplay to create an experience that pokes fun at the hardships of being a dad to one extreme while also showing the dedication of a father to provide happiness for his family. This is exemplified by the beginning tasks of making coffee, doing yardwork, and helping the kids out start their day while also avoiding a run in with a sushi chef who is coming to cook your tentacles in front of your family.   This sort of tone is kept throughout the entire experience as the player navigates the trials of the backyard, the grocery store, the various areas of an aquarium, a first date with the Miss and a made-up story by the wife and daughter of their father being a surgeon. Hidden throughout these areas with clear tasks are optional side objectives, secret cosmetic ties and tons of Easter Eggs related to nerd culture like a cereal named Total Biscuits. All of its humor is what you would expect from a story about an octopus wearing a three-piece suit to make himself a father, and the game never lets up on its comedy even when it has moments to build the bonds of their family the game will take the time to poke fun at the situation. This is the kind of experience where it pays to examine all the areas of the game as it’s not a long experience even with Octodad’s Shorts.   Seven Arms for Every Day of the Week, One to Hold the Calendar  As far as novel concepts goes, Octodad never overstays its welcome and its workshop support adds some longevity to the experience to make an afternoon of playing Octodad entertaining. An afternoon is probably for the best before the novelty would begin to wear away.   Had the game extended the concept beyond its limitations of creating a frustrating experience it would most likely be to the game’s detriment. Now while a couple hours’ worth of laughs alone or with family and friends isn’t going to sell everyone on Octodad there is something of an experience worth playing rather than watching on YouTube. Whether it’s to remember the good times of a parental figure or to have someone cheer you up, Octodad is always there to provide you laughs at his own comedic expense tumbling down the stairs.","hours":6.5}

Any non-normal movement while people is near you will lead to a \"suspicious\" over you. If bar fills up, you are caught. Movements like rolling over a banana shell and falling is a suspicious movement. Also, while moving around, destroying everything near you will your arms or legs. Can't say more due to not finishing game yet.   About graphics, being a indie game, is very well developed. It has that \"animated look\" everywhere, and is pleasant to my eyes. Sounds are very good, especially when Dad must talk. What I totally hate is camera. You can't move camera around, and that makes some situations a lot difficult. Also, camera changes while you are moving. That means, if you have sticks in controllers towards \"up\" position, and camera change, you could do something bad in game and get caught if you don't change instantly stick directions. But if you like challeges, this won't be a problem. Besides that, difficulty in game is translated in how fast is filled suspicious bar and how much precise should be your movements.  In general, this game is very good. If you want to play something funny, pick it up for sure.","hours":1.5}

The workshop list is currently fairly short, but at the end of the day, game was released only few days ago.  I absolutely loved the level of interaction you have with the surrounding environment. Missions are exciting and while being linearly story-driven, every major level has a certain sandbox zone where you can enjoyably mess around with everything you see.  When I was playing the ‘fix-the-aquarium’ mission, one story from my past came to mind. I have a friend with whom we attended the same boarding school. One day we decided to play Titan Quest (2007), which was just released. So here we are, approaching the final boss, but as we will find out later, our game was somehow corrupted, which made that NPC immortal. After failing our tenth desperate attempt to slay that mob, my friend shuts his laptop and punches it with fist as hard as he can, which also “coincidently” results in brutal death of his laptop.  What I am trying to say here is that people, who also get easily frustrated, may find this game difficult to enjoy due to complex controls and barriers towards getting hold of the hidden ties (collectibles). For the rest, if you do not mind closing a blind eye on a few bugs, you will find these 3-4 hours of gameplay absolutely pleasurable.","hours":10.6}

YEA! -Fun to play -Loveable characters -Controll Scheme is hard to use and master, but a blast anyhow  MEH! -How they not know your a octopus! -Better yet how did they reproduce? -Some things are a pain to accomplish  BLEH! -Too short  The Lowdown:  In octodad you play as as, well a octopus who must hide the fact that he is an octopus from his family. Yes, an octopus married a human and somehow had human kids! Doing so is not easy though as you must complete your every day chores and activities without raising suspicion. The control scheme involves you independantly moving your arms or feet to move accross the area and grab things. Sounds easy but ends up being difficulty to master. Neverless it is entertaining resulting in hillarious situations or screenshot moments.  The story is quite short and only will take a few hours to complete, But it makes up for it in all likeable characters, from your reporter wife who is too dumb to know your a sea creature, the loveable daughter who is the only one with a brain who knows your a sea creature. Then you have the main villain the sushi chef who wants to make you into his main course! Oh yea there is a son in there but he is the lame forgetable one...   Verdict: Will keep you entertained through its short playthrough that should be picked up at any sale price","hours":3}

If you ever wanted to know the trials and tribulations of walking around on four legs when you should be on eight, or trying to keep from being made into Odori-dun by some psychopathic chef, this is the game for you. Whether Tiny Octopus is hurling apples at people's heads or dumping chocolate milk all over the carpet, this game is as accurate a presentation of what it's like to be a cephalopod out of water.  Keep at it. You can do it. Soon, you'll understand what it is to be an octopus, and when we rise from the oceans, you will be ready to accept us as your cephalopodian overlords.

You play as an Octopus who pretends to be human and disguise himself within society. The physics are all over the place as you don't have any bones so you essentially flop around all over the place making even simple tasks like mowing the yard a challenge. + Story and characters are great and surprisingly emotional. You can almost feel sorry for Octodad as you know he's trying to so hard be a good father, but no one knows his struggles or what he's going through. + Lots of interesting fun environments filled with loads of items to knock over or have a small bit of fun with.   - At times certain levels can be pretty frustrating due to the controls.

An Octopus dressed as a human and nobody notices it , or somebody does? You will have to play it to know the answer.  Crazy controls, impossible to play with a mouse+keyboard and close to impossible to master with a controller. The game is SO easy but becomes a little bit frustrating due to the annoying but funny (and unique) movement mechanics. Some replayability options and collectibles, nice easter eggs for videogames freaks. The story is bah, but the game keeps you amused some hours.
