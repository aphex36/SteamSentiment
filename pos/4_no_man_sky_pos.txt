{"review":"So I pre-ordered this.  At the time, when I first played it, I came to regret that as a mistake. I sank a couple hours in here and there, but I just couldn't get into it. The story felt dull, the landscapes were just... off, and it just wasn't what was advertised.  I cast it aside, too late to refund.  Base building came out, along with vehicles, creative mode, and a camera. I played around with them, and they were fun - but the survival still felt lackluster. Creative mode got boring fast, and the camera (probably one of my favourite game features at the time) was hardly worth going into the game to use just for screenshots.  And now, after the Waking Titan ARG - we have Atlas Rises. To be honest - I'm impressed. Suddenly, I find myself wanting to play survival because it's fun. Hell, I find myself wanting to play the game itself because I enjoy it now, not because I'm bored and need to sink time into something. The story is interesting and I want to see more, dozens of tiny little things that weren't there suddenly are... It's a new experience.  In all honesty, I would have much preferred to see the game in this state on release. That way I would have been spared a year of disappointment. Hello Games has done what few developers would have done after the disaster of the release, and has spent time and effort making this game into something they can be proud of. It's clear they believe in the potential of No Man's Sky, and I find that inspiring.  I can finally, in good conscience, recommend this game. I think the price is still too steep - but I would recommend it on half price.","hours":29.3,"funny_percent":0.019400352733686066,"helpful_percent":0.8853615520282186}
{"review":"When the game first launched, I was incredibly dissapointed, I'd felt cheated out of 60 dollars. By the time I'd realized how bad it was, It was already too late for me to refund. A full year has passed since then, and I am utterly astounded by the progress that has been made in the development of this game. The dev team cares about this game, there's no way they'd have continued trying to make improvements to the game if they did not care.   Don't expect an action packed thriller, expect a calming experience. Despite the original uproar, where this game was placed in the middle of a massive shiticane, the game still manages to place in me a childlike wonder that I have yet to experience since I was... a child. The awe and wonder of discovery as you first explore the planet you were crashed on continues as you make your way out of the atmosphere, and eventually to the stars. The music only adds to the atmosphere(pun intended), and is still good without the game.   So let's go over the pros and cons since the original launch.  pros  +Overhauled story (latest update) 30 hours +Mission system (latest update) +System Economies, wealth, conflict +MULTIPLAYER!? (limited) (currently VOIP, but the foundations of more complex multiplayer) +Worlds have been improved since launch +scenic crashed freighters +NPC Guilds that you can join and earn standing with. +interstellar trading +improved space combat +improved Atmospheric flight +many new ships +temperature measurement can be in freedom units +freighters +base building +way less stuttering and lag than at launch (could be my updated graphics card) +Atmospheric, calming gameplay(again, pun intended) +The dev team cares  cons  -When you boil it down, it still continues to be a survival game about farming resources. -Priced too high compared to other games you can get.  Summary  The devs are committed and the game is beautiful. Still overpriced, I reccomend picking it up when it is on sale. The game is becoming what we were originally promised. Thank you Sean Murray, I finally feel like I'm getting close to my money's worth with this game.  6/10  ~Astr0","hours":57,"funny_percent":0.022769516728624536,"helpful_percent":0.8113382899628253}
{"review":"New Review for Atlas Rises Update  From the perspective of one who has played this game from the first release...  Hello Games, with the release of Atlas Rises, you have vandalized countless hours of patient discovery, rendered thousands of units of stored products obsolete, damaged my base, ravaged my home planet, and killed my dog.*  But, before I go all John Wick on you, I suppose I can put in a few hours of play to see if this new version of No Man's Sky has anything to recommend it --- at least I will after you stop patching it so that I can update my mods properly....  * Note: Claim of dog murder may be exaggerated.  ....After Installing Patch 1.35  I'm still wrestling with the mods, but never mind, I'll play unmodded for a while.  I didn't start over from scratch, but I did play through the official Atlas Rises quest line. It's not bad. Without spoiling it, I can say you will learn a lot about the back story of the three sapient lifeforms, and your own story as well. It will also introduce the new mission system and some new factions.  As I mentioned in my opening rant, the new update resets a lot of what came before. The planet generator has been revamped, and in the process all previous planets were regenerated. That beautiful, lush paradise that was your favorite hang-out? Gone -- replaced by a newly generated world. It might still be nice, or it might be a wasteland. That is particularly annoying on the world where you have your base. And, if you built parts of your base outside the defined boundary, those parts will be gone, too.  The worlds you discovered and named still exist -- sort of. You discovered them, they're in your list, and yet you must re-discover them again. When you scan for creatures, the old ones you found before are still listed, but they are around anymore, and there are new ones. It's really odd.  I'm not sure why the discovered worlds couldn't have been preserved. Resetting them has no impact on new players, but it's upsetting to the veterans who've spent the most time playing, and the most time supporting this game. It seems short-sighted.  I was so depressed about the changes to my home planet that I decided to move away. Far, far away. After completing the Atlas Rising quest, I traveled all the way out to the 10th galaxy, which is named Eissentam. The No Man's Sky Gamepedia reports that it seems to have a larger number of lush planets that other galaxies, which I thought sounded nice. I found a pretty place to build a new base, and I'm settling in quite well.  By the way, the games still breaks all your stuff when you jump to a new galaxy. I don't put up with that crap. I just open the save game file, search for \"DamageFactor\": 1.0, and replace it with \"DamageFactor\": 0.0. Problem solved.  New Stuff  The new planet generator supposedly produces more rational planets. I don't know about that, they seem pretty much like the old planets. There are some nice new things:  Exotic Planets - These have some very different types of things in place of the more conventional flora and fauna, such as shards of metal, bubbles, glowing cones, and weird cog-like things. It's pretty cool.  Crashed Freighters - There are crashed freighters on some planets, which you might be able to loot. It will at least make for some dramatic screen shots.  Freighter Hyperdrives - Speaking of freighters, you can now use your freighter to jump between systems with you and your ships inside. If you are playing without mods, the freighter, when maxed out, is capable of jumps that are about 20% farther than your ship. To actually jump, go to the place where your freighter's captain stands, and approach the glowing spherical map thing.  Inventories - On of the better new things, these are extra inventory pages in your exosuit, starship, and freighter. All three gain an extra page for \"Technology\", where you can install technology upgrades without consuming general inventory slots. It sounds great -- but there's a big catch.  Certain technology items are \"core\" units, which can't be dismantled or moved (at least not without mods). Those units must remain on the General inventory page. Since you need to add technology upgrades in slots adjacent to their main unit to get the synergy bonuses, all of those upgrades will have to stay on the General page too. Also, you will want to keep rechargeable technology on the General page, because it's much faster to open that page for a refill. All of that leaves a limited range of technologies that you will want to place on the Technology page. It's not useless, by any means, but it's a lot less helpful than it could have been.  Your exosuit also gets a third inventory page, named \"Cargo\". This is the most useful one. The slots have a high capacity, like your ship slots, for substances or products. Once you have built up a supply of stuff, you can operate independently of the resources in your ship. Technology can be recharged, and products and base elements can be crafted directly out of the Cargo inventory.  However, moving inventory between the General and Cargo pages in your exosuit is absurdly clumsy. There should be a simple left-and-right layout like when you are swapping ships -- but no, you must laboriously move each item by switching from page to page. Worse yet, there appears to be no way to access the Cargo inventory while trading goods. Really?  Mission System - You still have the old main missions, like \"Atlas Path\", but now you can have a whole list of secondary missions. This includes familiar ones like the base technician missions, but also faction-based missions for the three sapient lifeforms and the new Guild factions: Merchants, Mercenaries, and Explorers.  Standing System - You still have your basic standing with the three sapient lifeforms, but there are now multiple factors that contribute to that standing, and new standing ratings for the new Guild factions.  Portals - I never understood all the hype about the portals before, but anyway, they are now a thing that work, if you know the glyphs. There is some major lore around portals.  Terrain Manipulator - Interesting idea, but it's a crude first attempt. This needs a lot of work by the developers to become useful.  Game Guide - Finally! A built in guide to how stuff works in the game. The original game was needlessly obscure and confusing. The new guide finally explains things you should know, given that you are out in the universe, flying around in starship and so forth. Why were you so ignorant of everything before anyway? (Actually, that might be explained during a certain quest...)  Seeing Other Player's Avatars - I haven't seen this. Going by the samples, it looks a bit silly, but it does mean that there is now infrastructure in place to begin supporting multi-player. I'm not sure if folks really understand how challenging real-time multi-player interaction is. It requires a big investment in hardware and software infrastructure to connect, move, and coordinate the required data. Multi-player was the big promise that was broken by the developers, of course, so I guess they feel compelled to make it happen. Personally, I don't care all that much.  Summary  I was really disappointed that things that I had built got trashed. From here on I will assume that it will happen again, and act accordingly. But with a nice new storyline, new stuff to do, weird new planets to visit, and all the old features still there, I will definitely enjoy the game more.  For new buyers, it's still overpriced. With the current feature set, I'd call it about a $35 (USD) value, maybe $40 max. Adding some actual player interaction would change that quite a bit.","hours":536.3,"funny_percent":0.02893772893772894,"helpful_percent":0.7985347985347986}
{"review":"This was my review prior to the 1.1 update ________________________________________________________________________________ \"This game has failed miserably, I am VERY annoyed that I am stuck with this garbage in my game library because it is completely terrible and I will most likely never play it again. When the game first came out it had over 200,000 players on at one point, now there is a mear 800. If that doesn't prove this game is the biggest scam of 2016 I don't know what does. The devs completely lied about countless features that were meant to be in this game.\" ________________________________________________________________________________  I clearly had very strong feeling about the game after playing for about 40 or so hours, but now that Hello Games have released the new update I decided I needed to revist the game in order to see what sort of improvements were made.  Obviously the update doesn't add all the features we were told about before the game was launched, but it does add content that we had all hoped to receive and that's awesome. It shows that Hello Games have started taking a step in the right direction in hopes to fix their game. I really did enjoy the game when it first was released, but did quickly realize how much content was actually not in the game. It's very nice to see the developers going back to try fixing this by adding content many players were excited about.  Thoughts about the 1.1 update ______________________  Game Modes -------------- - The additon of game modes is very nice, I think it's a great way to allow different kinds of players to enjoy the game.  The three modes are  Normal - this is what most players who revisit the game will know, it's basically the same as before 1.1 but with the new content such as base building  Survival - Practically the same as normal, but with a very steep learning curve. I personally really loved the challenge, you start in a random location on a planet (from my multiple games I noticed all the planets had some sort of harsh environment), and in order to get your ship you have to gather materials and reach you ship (the ship seemed to be anywhere from 8-15 minutes away from your spawn location)  Creative - Much like creative mode in minecraft. You have god mode, and unlimited materials. It's a great mode for building up a base if you want to see what all you can do with it.  Base Building __________  - The base building is fun and simple. Being able to set up a planet as a \"home base\" was something I was excited about from the start of the game, it's very simple and I can already tell how useful the bases will actually be. They will not be something you spend time on and then forget about within an hour.  - Hiring people from the different races is an interesting way to liven up the bases.  - As you hire people to work at your base they will give you missions to go gather materials in order to advance or learn how to make a new building, the \"base researches\" is a great way to add somwhat of a \"questing system\".  - Within the bases it seems like you have you own personally space stations, which is very nice. No more flying back and forth once you fill up your ship with materials.  - Having a teleporter that can transport you from the space station to your base is actually very cool, I always hated having to fly to the space station just to buy some material I couldn't find on the planets easily.  Materials _______   - The new materials are interesting, I like the idea of needing to research certain equipment in order to harvest new materials.  - Some of the new materials require you to have sort of gauntlet in order to harvest, I think it's great that you now need more than just your multi-tool in order to fully harvest a planet for all of its worth.   As I said above I really enjoyed experiencing the new content and found it very simple yet enjoyable. I think it's great to see Hello Games finally make a comeback after letting down so many people, it's obvious they spent a lot of time on the new content in order to make it up to the older players and to make sure they gave quality content to their players.  ________________________________________________________________________________ This is probably the part where I start to get thumbs down because of my review ________________________________________________________________________________  After revisiting NMS and checking out the newest update I think 99% of the recent reviews on this game should be removed. They are clearly people who hardly tried the game before deciding they wanted to give it a negative review like everyone else. If you read their reviews they can't even tell you want they disliked about the game, how can you give a negative review but not explain what you disliked.  I think Hello Games did a great job with the 1.1 update, and I think that most of the negative reviews should be ignored until you get the check out the game yourself.

{"review":"While I kinda \"enjoyed\" the game at release, I was quickly dissapointed by the expectations that they forced upon me. I eventually gave up after about 100 hours because it just wasnt what I wanted.  Advance time by one year and here we are. With their latest huge update, they showed me that they do care about the state of the game and they brought it much closer to what I once believed this game would be judging by the videos and screenshots of E3.  I had to mod this game to actually enjoy it previously, now?  Most of the mods I used are implemented into the game and I don't even think I really want to mod the game anymore other than maybe reshade.  You can now: -call your ship to you -teleport to your freighter -farming -building -terraforming(you were able to destroy, but now you can create) -vehicles -more quests and factions -more variety -muchhhhhh better graphics -30hr story expansion -Multiplayer(sorta like a beta but it works!) Honestly I can go on, but I really just wanna go play..!! With the special its on, if you were ever hesitant about this purchase, do it. You'll immerse yourself into a grand sandbox universe.

{"review":"What a rollercoaster this game is.  I pre-ordered, and felt absolutely cheated when the initial release came. We've all read the news stories and seen the enraged posts online -- the lying, the deceptive claims, the huge tracts of missing content. Many developers would have taken a hit like that and sunk their game in the deepest hole they could find.  Instead, the devs spent a year making update after update, all free, slowly struggling to live up to the grandiose claims they'd made in the first place. It's still not as ideal as actually releasing the game as promised in the first place, but now, finally, No Man's Sky feels something like an actual game. With some faint glimmers of story and worldbuilding wrapped around the gorgeous procedural galaxies, it's able to hold itself together -- if only just.  It's still not worth the full price, but I would eagerly suggest grabbing it on sale. It's beautiful, the music is lovely, the takeoff-to-orbit flight has zero loading screens, and every update has improved the game. There's not much story or ultimate goal to speak of, but it's not about rescuing a space princess. It's just about seeing what's out there. And now, at last, the answer is \"something\".  EDIT:  TL;DR / Summary -- They lied and called an Early Access game a polished blockbuster, but after tons of updates and two DLC Expansion sized upgrades, the game is juuuuust about worth buying on sale, if only for some truly beautiful procedural vistas.","hours":219.8,"funny_percent":0.04380475594493116,"helpful_percent":0.7446808510638298}

Hello Games did not do this.  A year on, the game has absolutely received a year's worth of hard work that has fundamentally changed and improved it, with entire fully-fleshed new systems being added with each major update. Perhaps this is a sign that, yes, it was released far too early, or it should have released into Early Access, and it's not going to change the fact of a 1.0 release that's universally referred to with terms like \"debacle.\"  But this isn't a review of 1.0; it's a review of 1.3, in which, by the way, you can now build colonies and buy capital ships and employ aliens and drive hoverbikes and oh my god so much more.  1.3 is Hello Games' redemption.","hours":30.2,"funny_percent":0.08394160583941605,"helpful_percent":0.7281021897810219}
{"review":"This review has been written after the release of the Pathfinder update.  I have to admit: i was on the hype train for this game, and i suffered for it. But while everyone was refunding the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game i still had hope.  Let's get something out of the way real quick: this game is nowhere near perfect yet. Emphasis on the \"yet\"; But after the updates that Hello Games have released i'm sure this game will be amazing eventually. Hello Games have made COLOSSAL mistakes while marketing this game. 1. They advertised and priced it as a AAA game, while they should have gone the Early Access route. 2. They made trailers showing features that were only possible if you got Lottery winner level lucky. 3. They went completely radio silent after release.  I haven't played this game since the Foundation update released, and i can directly compare the base game and the Pathfinder update game. Here's my thesis: I downloaded the update. For the sake of a clean slate i decided to start a new game. Immediately i noticed some positive diffrences. I have been thrown on a very green planet, which were ♥♥♥♥ing impossible to find in the base game, but let's assume i got lucky. In the next system i found another beautiful green planet with amazing rock formations, tons of trees and interesting fauna, which was surprising. Also, the UI was more responsive and had more quality of life features, the space stations were more populated, and i've had more encounters with freighters and pirates than i've ever had before. Some of which were really cinematic and awesome looking. I might be wrong, but i think HG are doing a lot more in updates than they say they do.  Long story short, i think this game is going in the right direction. It will never compete with the ultra realistic Star Citizen, for me it will always be a chill exploration game like Minecraft. Thank you Hello Games for not giving up, it just shows that you guys have balls of steel.  P.S: I find it hillarious that under every NMS update video there's people who bash the game for still existing, saying \"you'll never be good, just end it\".

The developer seems to have pulled a complete 180 and is very responsive to player feedback. New updates come out regularly and relate directly to player feedback. The game is beautiful and immersive and has kept me interested well beyond 100 hours. I still have tons of story left to work through and don't feel like I have wasted my time.   Update 1 -  After another 30 or 40 hours, everything is still going well.  I just recently discovered a whole new planet biome and spent a solid hour just walking around staring at stuff and taking pictures in picture mode. Check out my screenshots to see some neat stuff.  My six year old son has started playing in Creative mode and loves it. He always asks to play No Man's Sky over all his LEGO games.   Update 2 -  I started a Creative game and have been pleasently surprised. I thought I would get bored within an hour because everything is free to build and charge (unlimited resources), but no, the freedom to ignore resources have given me a little boost in my hunt for unique biomes and interesting creatures and vistas.  With Creative Mode you still have story progression and you still have to acquire blueprints in the normal way. Exploration is still the main theme and is still required to get much accomplished. However, as with all the game modes, you can choose to just stay on your first planet for as long as you want.  Still lots of fun.

{"review":"I've waited a while to post a review for this. Wanted to collect my thoughts on it. After having watched the drama of this game's release unfold, I'm convinced that there are in fact, three No Man's Skys.  1. The game 'the hype' promised- and never delivered 2. The game that fifty-thousand raging neckbeards can't seem to stop despising 3. The game it actually is.  As I wasn't on the hype train (I bought the game shortly after the Foundation Update), and I'm not especially prone to groupthink or fits of unreasoning rage either, I'll try to address that third game- because I do think gaming journalism is messed up.  I just happen to also think that the primary dysfunction has essentially become a difference of extremes.  Which is another way of saying: \"trying to buy a game amid all these histrionics is like driving drunk.\"  Not- mind you- that I don't think that what happened with 'the hype' isn't reprehensible. It is.   On the other hand I also think it's unfortunate in the sense that there is an audience for a game like this. It's probably a far smaller one than the hype generated, but it's also probably larger than the wave of hate that followed it's release (that continues to follow the release) allows for.   So what is that third game? Well, it's an atmospheric exploration game with crafting and some survival elements.   It has some action, but it's not an action-oriented game. It has some survival elements- but this isn't \"hardcore\"in that regard and I don't see it ever being. It's got some crafting elements- but the list ins't tremendously expansive and the flow isn't necessarily... optimized. It's set in space- replete with different races, lore for those races, factions and so on- but it's not a free-form Mass Effect, no.  What it does well is it's sense of ambience and atmosphere, while giving you a little of all of the above things. Some might find this boring (and even I tire of it from time to time), but I don't think that the mere fact that you can be bored with a game necessarily makes it a bad game.  This isn't a game for everyone- as I think I said above. But if you think you might find the idea of exploring a vast-feeling universe for a bit, while occupying yourself with gathering and cataloguing things, you might enjoy playing this game.  I know I have.  One thing I will absolutely agree with most of this game's detractors on is the price (at least the $60 one used at release).   This is a $30 game- at most.   That puts it in a similar category with a lot of other games like it.  So, if you do get it, wait for a sale- definately. But again, keep in mind that there's a lot of nonsense surrounding the game's release. It's easy to avoid the over-hyping of the game nowadays since it's out and we've got plenty of it's features catalogued and we know what the game is and isn't.  But it's still easy to fall victim to the rage train still following the game. Make your own decision. Don't let anyone else (including me) tell you what to buy.","hours":113.3,"funny_percent":0.023672424824056303,"helpful_percent":0.6052463211772233}
{"review":"\"It's a weird game, it's a niche game and it's a very very chill game.\" That's what Sean Murray wrote in his last post on the NMS site before the game was released, and it's still the most accurate description. It may be the kind of weird that many people don't like, too niche for the average gamer, or chill in a way that some people find boring, but if you give it a chance you may be surprised to find it's the kind of game you never knew you wanted.  I've recently realised that it has become my favourite game, and even though I sometimes need a long break from it when things start to feel stale, I always come back and end up losing many nights of sleep to it. It doesn't have a big learning curve, which makes jumping back in even after months of absence really easy and is one of the reasons it's such a chill experience.  If you wait for adventure to find you without putting any effort into it, it might never come and you could end up hating everything this game chooses to be. There are no conventional quests, which sometimes means you need a sense of imagination and willingness to set your own goals. (Update after 1.3: Quests have been added to the game now.) It doesn't tell you how to play or force you on a set path. Everyone's journey is different. You could dedicate dozens of hours to discovering the lore or completely ignore it in favour of hunting down pirates. Set course for the center of the galaxy or settle down and build a base in one of the many community-made hubs. Become a zoologist and make it into the Hall of Fame for discovering the largest aquatic creature. Assemble the prettiest collection of pink starships. Plant a farm of space weed and become rich. The universe is your playground.  NMS is a large canvas with endless possibilities for expansion. It's been great to see it evolve over the past year. I admire Hello Games for not giving up on their dream and their community despite the backlash they had to endure, and can't wait to see what they have in store for us next.","hours":387.3,"funny_percent":0.03305785123966942,"helpful_percent":0.6018031555221638}
{"review":"The 1.1 update is amazing. If you still have the game, give it another chance. I recommend it!  1.1, sadly, is how this game should have launched, with the promise of more to come afterward.   Great work Dev Team, keep it up!  Edit(12/17/2016):  I fell for the hype and purchased the game when it was nearly full price (I did use a coupon to lower the price before buying, because I never really buy games at full price). It was a mistake. The base game was great fun for about 4 hours, and then it fell apart when I started to see that the gameplay was overly repetative and the features were lacking.  This update brought many features that brought me back and had me playing for many of the hours I refused to invest in the first version of the game due to the fact that it just felt tedious.  I agree with many that the game should have been launched as a $20 or less indie game, rather than at a big budget cost.  I also agree that the 1.1 update brings some items to the game that should have bee there to begin with. As I said, 1.1 is how the game should have launched... and add that to the edited in comment about $20 dollars or less being the pricepoint.  They made a ton of mistakes in the marketing and launch of the game, however I have hope that it can still be made great long after the hype, and be enjoyable. I have hope that somehow they can patch in a large sum of content that might bring the value closer to the price point it launched at, however I know that is not very likely.  I am not forgiving the horrible marketing of this game, and far too early featureless release of the game. I'm just hoping they can keep adding to the game that I already own, and continue moving it in a direction that brings it closer to the hyped promises that brought me to purchase it early on at launch.  If only they had just called it an 'Early Access' alpha / beta, rather than a full release...","hours":59.4,"funny_percent":0.04927408710954685,"helpful_percent":0.592608886933568}

Well one year later, and that statement above couldn't be further from the truth. I strongly believe that No Man's Sky is now the game that we were promised it would be, and the devs show no sign of stopping there. The once boring and linear storyline that lasted 30 minutes is now a diverse storyline that branches off into different stories, that you can explore and follow however you want. 12 hours in and I'm still nowhere near done with the story. You now no longer have to just fly around aimlessly with your tiny ship, you can trade ships or find ships at crashsites and repair them, you can buy your own capital freightership, you can make your own base and recruit a crew, there are space battles, pirates, side missions, etc. What I'm trying to say here is that a LOT has changed, if you haven't tried NMS yet or bought it originally but just uninstalled it, give it a chance, you will be amazed how far it has come.","hours":24.1,"funny_percent":0.025157232704402517,"helpful_percent":0.6415094339622641}

{"review":"EDIT AT BOTTOM: No Man's Sky is a beautiful game that started out a little slow but has progressed over the year since release and thanks Hello Games for still updating it after the hate you got at release And not running with the money. So in the 18 hours (at the time i wrote this review) i have had more fun than most of these open world space survival titles, the game just has so much to do and so much beauty that it feels nice to play and has potential so please Hello Games dont give up you have done good so far and i want to see the future of this game.  So that said i will give you the Pro's and Con's i have come across at 18 hours (This review will be updated after updates)  Pro's: (at 18 hours in)  - So many planets, So many possibilities - Base building - Land and air vehicles (always fun to have a bit of both) - Amazing crafting system with the whole blueprint system (In my opinion btw) - Unique way to upgrade your ship thaty you dont see it in many of these genres (again in my opinion) - Combat system and the game itself feels relaxing (I dont know about you but i felt relaxed while killing sentinals)  Con's: (at 18 hours in)  - By god the optimization needs a bit of work  - The crashing is a little bit of a problem (Not sure if thats just me but i get them every couple of hours) - The stuttering can be annoying when it happens at times  This concludes this part of the review but i will update over time, But my overall review for the game is that its a very beautiful, fun and relaxing game that i will be spending more time on and watch it as it develops (Please Hello Games develop this game). Thanks!  Edit: This review will not be updated at the moment dues to the new update crashing my game after i leave my ship and the horrible 10 fps on average (I dont know if thats just me but only happend after the new update)","hours":23.6,"funny_percent":0.0228310502283105,"helpful_percent":0.6210045662100456}
{"review":"NO MAN'S SKY  NO MAN'S SKY is an exploration, space, survival style game, its NOT a game that everyone will enjoy. I can say this, the game so far has some very pretty planets at times, and other times the planets can be barren meaning planets you land on have nothing good to see, and they can be dangerous with low oxygen levels OR very cold/hot/toxic & so on. Main aim in this game is to survive, discover & farm out plenty differant resources, all while exploring & discovering plants & creatures you come across, some are friendly if you feed them some NOT so friendly plants included, though I have NOT feed a plant yet!. You will need these resourses to craft, repair, replenishing your weapon & ship & exosuit also for upgrading & trading, & im sure theres much more. You can also stay on a planet, if you like that particular planet OR you can leave and find a better planet, its all up to the players discretions  Watch out for the centinals drones if you farm to much, they will attack you so be prepared ;)  When you first start out with the game, you will find your stranded on a planet that could be toxic as in my case, with a damaged ship, you will have set tasks to carry out so you can repair your ship, and leave the planet. Watch your exosuit and health gauges, if they start to get very low use your scanner, & try find your ship to jump back into, OR find a cave OR building so you can replenish BUT watch the lower white health gauge, you will need to find health canisters OR a mineral it requires to replenish. YES it can be confusing at first with the way the inventry and features are layed out, this can confuse and frustrate alot of players the most, as it does with me. BUT with trial and error and more playing, you will start to understand and remember how things work with in the game. Im still learning myself :P   Im quite new to this game, and im also very surprised my laptop can even run it, when it shouldnt. I do have all settings set low with 30 framerates set in as well, my framerates do flutuate while playing. I still can play and enjoy the game nicely, so no complaints from me :) others would not tolerate these low framerates, but Im not bothered by them :P   There is still alot you can explain about the game, but I just cant cover everything here, im still new and learning myself. All I will say is give the game a chance, its not terrible and its not the best game. I like exploring and discovering and looking for new things to see, so this game is right up my alley except for the complicated crafting elements which I will learn as I continue to play and progress I hope. BY the way ,you start out with limited inventry space, so inventry on both exosuit and ship fill up fast as mine now has.I need to work out what to do next?  PRICEWISE: I feel this game should be more a $20 to $30 game at RRP not the Currant $59.99usRRP. SO BEST buy when on sale for a VERY decent discount, as I do honestly feel alot of players will soon get very bored with a game like this, YOU WILL BE GRINDING ALOT believe me, BUT i am one of those people that really dont mind grindy games if they are fun   P.S. Hello Games Please add some trading cards, nice badges & backgrounds & some VERY nice emoticons please, bout time this game had some now I think ;D","hours":56.1,"funny_percent":0.010101010101010102,"helpful_percent":0.6161616161616161}
{"review":"I don't really know where to start with this game but I'll do my best..  I play this game to relax or detach from real life. It's vastness is serene, and the fruitlessness of your time is, to me, almost comforting. There's no competition, no leader boards - there isn't a meta... it's just you and an unexplored galaxy to experience. The futility of the game is important to acknowledge in the beginning so expectations can be adjusted accordingly. To me, it's this aspect of NMS that makes it so great.  The game is visually stunning, the music is phenomenal, the worlds unique and full of things just waiting to be discovered. I can't get enough of the game.   If you need clearly defined missions/objectives/goals the game isn't for you. You will love this game if you can infer objectives and goals, and like single-player exploration. I'm not sure where people got it in their head that this would be a Star Citizen-like game, with fully developed FPS and story elements, but having kept track of all publicity leading up to the game... it delivers its one core promise that No Man's Sky is a \"chill exploration experience\".","hours":235.9,"funny_percent":0.05416666666666667,"helpful_percent":0.5944444444444444}

{"review":"A lot of things have changed for this game and it's been quite a controversial game since last year's launch owing to overpromising but under delivering.   At it's current state it's a much better game and approaching what was promised though it still has ways to go in terms of adding depth to make the game extremely compelling.  The mission and economy system now injects some more life to the universe and appears like a more basic version of what is currently available in Elite Dangerous in regards to missions and trading and such.   It is encouraging and brave for a developer who's received so much flak continue to work hard and add so much a year on. Though I guess at this point it's a matter of reputational survival that they probably decided not to give up. If they don't really try to fix it and win back the hearts of the public at large then no new projects by HG and members of th development team will gain traction in the future. But I digress.  However, I still believe that no matter how far they add, I believe that the game's core will remain and that will only appeal to a certain type of gamer and I believe Sean Murray's statement that it's a \"niche game and it's a very chill game\" will remain true going forward. I feel people need to continue to keep this in mind. It's a game about exploration and 'the journey' as opposed to the destination. You play this to relax, enjoy the sights and not to necessarily grind day to day. You determine your own objectives, your own goals, your own benchmark for success or achievement in any particular play session. That is not for everyone.  The main gripes I see with the game has been the lack of variety and I believe this will eventually be iterated upon by HG as they continue to add assets. As evident in 1.3 with the new biomes and asset variety, this can really make planets, flora and fauna more diverse in the future.  I would suggest people who had not bought it or refunded at launch to jump in and those who still have the game to try it again and perhaps update your review. The fact they are adding this much and supporting it continuously is more than most AAA publishers or studios these days. I for one will be continuing to support HG and look forward for what else they have to offer.","hours":39.4,"funny_percent":0.045454545454545456,"helpful_percent":0.9090909090909091}

{"review":"The 'mostly negative' reviews made me not buy this game for the first year after release, but after 3 major free content updates I decided to take the gamble.   So far I am having a good time in the game with exploring on the different planets and trying to find out more about the alien spieces. There is suposed to be a 30 hour story mode in the game too, but I haven't even started it yet as I am still busy with trying to setup a home planet and a base. I bought the game and basically played the whole day without noticing it, I looked at the clock and saw it was already 4AM in the morning :)  From what I can tell the game is huge. I haven't even left my home solar system yet and there are hundreds or even more other solar systems out there to explore. No doubt you can spend hundreds of hours playing the game without even reaching the 'end goal' of the game.  So far (first dozen hours) the game has a lot of grinding (mining), because you basically start with nothing more than an environmental suit and a broken/crashed space craft. Starting with nothing you have to gather resources to craft components and repair your ship and after that you have to grind a lot more to get enough money to buy other 'needed' goods. From what I have read the grinding mainly exists in the starting phase of the game. Once you have setup a good functioning base with alien staff and workers the resource gathering will become partially automated.  I can see myself playing this game for a long time to come and I am happy that I took the 'gamble'. The 'mostly negative' review tag is really unfair to the game in it's current state. The game feels really immersive and fairly fleshed out so I can only tag it as 'positive'.  The game does seem to be really heavy on the GPU. With an OC'd 970 I get around 40fps (high settings) when I am on a planet. Though, it does not feel sluggish or anything. I can only really tell be looking at the fps counter, the game plays and feels smooth at 40fps. When I fly into space the fps recovers and I get that 60+ fps again.  I think that 60 bucks for this game is still a pretty steep price, but if you see it for 40 bucks or less I highly recommend picking this game up (if you like this kind of gameplay and genre).   Edit after 65h gameplay:  There are quite a lot of bugs and glitches I ran into and some aspects of the game are not greatly designed, such as the inventory system. And the grind is real so far. I spend 80% of the time mining for stuff so that I can craft basic things and to get money to upgrade my exosuit. I still don't have biodomes where I can auto farm basic goods. So be aware of this, you will be grinding a lot in this game. You can minimize the grinding by playing 'Creative Mode', but you will not get achievements nor milestones in that game mode.","hours":93.1,"funny_percent":0.017857142857142856,"helpful_percent":0.6785714285714286}
{"review":"INTRO This review covers a lot of the political repercussions of the poor launch reception but also discusses some key game features and their improvements. The nature of this review can cause quite a controversy so read at your own risk.  IMPORTANT NOTE FOR IMPROVEMENT The game is much more likely to achive a greater improvement if the development team is motivated to improve it. Negative reinforcement alone is not a good motivator at all and in fact can leave the person or people in question unmotivated to do anything. I feel that if we want to see good improvements on this game we should give more support to the good features of the game but in so we must not forget the bad ones either.  GRINDING Well the game has a lot of grinding as do other games and the grinding can be fun, but if you are just playing the game to complete it, then the grinding becomes the main objective and it can become very boring, if you take your time to explore and scan creatures and appreciate some of the good ones then you can expect to have a nice evened out experience.  SIZE OF THE GAME The game is big, very big. The game consists of more planets than you will ever be able to set foot on so there is that but at the same time this is just kind of an illusion as you are going around from planet to planet, eventually you will realise that there is not a huge amount of variation amoungst the plannets. But, there is enough to give you that illusion if you let it, of course you can nit pick and look really closely and break the illusion but you are only doing that to yourself, take it like a picture best viewed from a certain distance.  EXPLORATION It is no lie that No Man's Sky has a veriety of means to produce novel situations to the player, this is wonderful and really helps drive your onwards, the creatures that you discover can be very different from one another. However, you need to take this with a pinch of salt, it can't be easy trying to populate a game with all kinds of new creatures when the game is as big as No Man's Sky. There is a wonderful video that explains how the creatures in No Man's Sky are made up, I recommend taking a look at it if you are interested.  STORY The game has an objective but also has freedom, the \"main\" objective (if you want to call it that) is to get to the center of the universe, yes you can do that but you can also take your time in doing so, that is how I have played it and I am enjoying myself doing so, you can really immerse yourself along the way and enjoy the game as an exploration.  SPACE TRAVEL Who does not love space travel, and no mans sky does it wonderfully, I can fly down to a planet and blast off from one with no loading screen and I can explore a vast collection of star systems and fly wherever I want, the game does this brillinatly. The only drawback from this is the inavbillity to fly close to structures and terrain with your space craft, this really breaks the illusion of flight and makes it feel like you are being bubble wrapped and your hand is being held, maybe I want to crash into the ground!!  GROUND COMBAT The combat in the game is some of the weakest combat I have experienced in gaming. However, the combat is there, it exists and I am happy that they put it in the game, the ground combat at least gives me some sense of danger whilst you are roaming around on the ground doing your thing. However the ground combat is really easy and does not pose much of a threat, this could really do with a tweak.  SHIP COMBAT Well, the ship combat in the game is a different story, I personally like the ship combat with a pinch of salt but yet again, the inabillity to fly close to objects and terrain ruin it so much, I want to fear the ground and other objects as I battle it out in my ship, I want to use them to my advantage as I take risks by flying close to the ground so that my enemy struggles to keep up. Besides this immersion breaker, the ship combat is awesome and does what it says on the tin. However, it is few and far between, you are not going to be finding a lot of combat unless you go out looking for it and even when you do it can take a while to find it.  CRAFTING & INVENTORY Of lord of lord, the crafting and inventory system needed a lot of work and work has been done. The inventory system was lacking to say the least and the crafting was simply combing two objects to make one, It felt very tacked on in the game. I am sorry Hello Games but this is one of the things that I couldn't stand in No Man's Sky and it needs an overhaul. I will however give it props that it does work and it does what it says on the tin so I can't complain too much, it is not somthing that will ruin your time playing No Man's Sky but sheesh, it could do with a little touch up.  VALUE A lot of people critise the game for its price and I completely get that, I do see how the game could be a bit too pricey, yes it is pretty costly but I am keeping my hopes up that with more and more updates the game will become worth the original money that I payed for it. The first update marks a great step towords a great game and I have faith that the updates will keep on rolling out  NOTE ON SUPPORT I know that the advertisement was really missleading and I know that the game was over hyped by a lot of people but if we keep throwing insults at the game just for the sake of it and just falling into confirmation bias, then all we will see is a crap game. Try not to be driven like a sheep with horse blinders on and make your own oppinion of the GAME and not the ADVERTISEMENT or POLOTICS that run with it. What we have here is a good game, its not the best game by any means but it is not a bad game at all. I have really enjoyed my time in No Man's Sky and will continue to play the game. Be unique and make your own oppinion of the game and don't follow the mass of people that are slandering the game for political reasons alone.  NOTE ON NEGATIVE REVIEWS The majority of negative reviews are unfortunatly the product of something called \"groupthink\" (look it up) Where a large mass has come together and followed majority view and slandered the game without any real thought, in fact a lot of the reviews you will see have only reviewed this game, so you can see by this that they are just jumping on the band wagon and giving it a negative review. HOWEVER! before you go crazy on me, some of the negative reviews, in fact a LOT of the negative reviews highlight a lot of really helpful things that the development team can take action on, these are constructive reviews and well explained personal oppinion and I respect them.  NOTE ON POSOTIVE REVIEWS The positive reviews on No Man's Sky are lacking and I am making an inference based on the key points I have discussed that this is a product of \"The bystander effect\" (look it up). Of course by saying this I am making the assumption that Hello Games is a victim in this and I know that will spark a rather large proportion of controvecy so please think of it as, this: Everyone is attacking the development team and no one wants to help by giving an alternate view, in fear of being attacked themselves. Yet again, I erge you to make your own oppinions.  TLDR The game itself is fantastic, I love it and will continue to play it, I have outlined a lot of the reasons as to why the game is seen as such a negative thing. The game has a few immersion breaking features but can be overlooked, as an exploration game its brilliant, as a survival/FPS, it lacks.  Overall I will recommend No Man's Sky not only to people that are new to it but also those that have purchased it before the update, give it another go and please make your own oppinion of the game, don't fall into \"groupthink\"  P.S I value all others oppinions and I am open to constructive criticism of my review. Respect people and people respect you.","hours":42.4,"funny_percent":0.03571428571428571,"helpful_percent":0.569327731092437}
{"review":"Initially i wrote a negative review - specifically because the flight controls were turned into garbage...until i realized - there HAS to be a better way. After a quick look around - not in the \"Controls\" section but under \"General\" i found it...the old flight mechanism can be re-activated.  Conclusion - don't jump to conclusions. I was totally wrong in my previous review so i've deleted it and am re-posting. Please forgive my idiocy. Yes, i can be short-sighted especially when game updates change my controls without first asking me if i want them changed.  NMS is WELL WORTH IT now. THIS is the game that should have been launched. I apologize to the creators and devs for my harsh comments and hope this review gets at least one new player to give it a try!  -LK","hours":493.7,"funny_percent":0.028846153846153848,"helpful_percent":0.625}
{"review":"Since the launch I've played over 60 hours and just scratched the surface of version 1.3 and it seems like a breath of fresh air. This game was something special before and now we get a huge update. I had a few months when I didn't play NMS at all. After that period I feel that NMS is a one of a kind. Sure it has it's flaws but the feeling of exploring and space traveling, there's nothing quite like it. I really liked the game when it was released, even during the ♥♥♥♥♥torm, but after these updates it's really getting better and better. So if you tried NMS before and felt that it lacked polish and content, but thought it was a cool concept, you should try it again.","hours":91.6,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.8181818181818182}
{"review":"I am suprised at how negative the reviews still are for this game. I bought this with some skepticism around the launch of the 1.3 Atlas Rises patch for $30 and I loved it (and Steam's \"recent reviews\" were remarkably positive, probably for the first time in this game's history with mixed overall). Now it's back to the negative, and that's ridiculous. If at this point you are still harshly judging this game based on it's initial hype and buildup, you need to realize you're the caustic a-holes that actually hurt the gaming community (seriously, would YOU want to develop a game for YOU?), and learn how to judge a game based on it's merits. This is the EXACT reason I try to avoid press conferences and early sneak peeks, and also why I never listen to what a developer tells me what will be in a game that isn't released yet. Seriously, devlopers telling you about their unreleased games are the equivalent of snake oil salesmen, and it's been like that for years. Don't be mad because you were stupid enough to be duped. /end rant  As far as the actual game goes, it is an enjoyable space survival game that is constantly being made better. It may feel incomplete to some, but personally I feel that way about this game in the same sense that I do about Sid Meier's games (like Pirates). Pirates feels EXACTLY as complete as this game (honestly, maybe even less so), and it's still highly regarded. You know why? It's fun! Not only that, it fills a gap in it's genre that doesn't have many good entries in it. I feel the exact same way about this game.  If you still go into this game with ridiculous expectations, then you deserve to be disappointed. But if you don't care about pre-release promises (or didn't bother yourself with hype and instead waited for release to figure out how a game would be like a sensible person) and really just want a space exploration/survival game, then this is easily worth $30 (anymore might be pushing it though. I should also note for a point of reference, I haven't considered a game worth more than $30 for a long time). If you DON'T care about exploring space, and you DON'T like survival games, then you'll probably be disappointed. That simple. Don't hate something that doesn't meet your ridiculous expectations, expecially if nothing else even comes close.  (I should point out my opinion may be slightly biased, both in the sense that I feel the need to defend something that is being attacked at a ridiculous level, and in the sense that I kind of get a nerd boner when a game is either set in space or feudal japan. Your mileage may vary, though I stand by the fact that I actually like this game a hell of a lot.)","hours":66.4,"funny_percent":0.03404255319148936,"helpful_percent":0.5829787234042553}

{"review":"- Path Finder Update -  I was as enraged as everyone else when the game first released but with the two major updates they've released, the game is actually progressively getting better. Definitely not worth the $60 yet, but it's getting there.  Honestly, I reinstalled it yesterday and I haven't put it down since. It's actually fairly fun now. Give No Man's Sky another chance and you'll see what I mean.  Edit: Also, if you're into screnshotting, the Photo Mode is a godsend. Could be improved a little, but I'm having a blast with it. (Screens on profile) Will update this review once another major patch is released.","hours":88.4,"funny_percent":0.01818181818181818,"helpful_percent":0.5772727272727273}
