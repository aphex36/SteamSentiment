Some people may argue that your choices don't actually matter, and I'd say they are not wrong... But they are not right either. The choices you make in the game may not have an impact on the end itself, but it will have an impact on how the story gets told to you. Will you become a respectable man, or will you be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ throughout the entire game? The choice is yours.   What does matter here is the travel, and not the destination.  The graphics are enjoyable; you really feel like you're part of the original comics universe. The game developpers also had the good idea to create their own story and not simply take the comics story. This is not a simple adaptation of the comics books, this is a parallel story which does not make some fan services; the references to the books are smart and really not invasive.  All in all, this is a simple, yet very enjoyable story-driven point-and-click, merging some humor and a lot of drama in a good and smart enough interactive story.  Turn the lights off, and play it alone or with someone else, and discuss about the choices you should make or should have made.  A must play!","hours":13.3}

{"funny_percent":0.03787878787878788,"helpful_percent":0.6237084481182996,"review":"By and large, most choice-driven games have followed the same formula, inviting you to make your mark in the world by deciding if you want to be “good” or “bad,” and accepting the binary nature of existence. But in the post-apocalyptic world of The Walking Dead, where the titular dead walk the decaying earth, the notion of good and bad is somewhat dated. There’s no “right” when right can mean shooting an innocent child before it can turn into a flesh-eating beast, and there’s no “wrong” when wrong can mean stealing the supplies you need to survive from those just as needy as you. The Walking Dead is the story of the choices you can’t live with, and the choices you can, coming together to create an experience as depressing and pessimistic as it is remarkable and memorable.  The Walking Dead never pretends to be anything less than a cruel, dour analysis of humanity’s downfall. You’re tossed into the cuffs of Lee Everett, a convicted murderer on his way to prison when the first episode begins. In the opening moments, his police escort is sidetracked by the zombie apocalypse, freeing Lee into a world that’s not nearly as comfortable as a jail cell would've been. Soon, he’s joined by the young Clementine, a child left on her own after her parents took a poorly timed vacation and her babysitter contracted a bad case of the flesh munchies. And off into the new, horrible world Lee goes, hoping to find Clementine’s parents despite knowing that they’re likely dead; off to find sanctuary when he doubts one even exists.  In stark contrast to the rest of gaming, The Walking Dead is more focused on what you do than how you do it. There aren’t many traditional puzzles, per se, as much as there are tasks that you’re asked to perform to move the story forward. Menial activities like finding batteries for a radio or starting up a train aren’t all that engaging by themselves, but they serve a very necessary pacing purpose, as well as give you a chance to explore the world a bit and get to know the characters better. If you’re looking to rampage around Georgia popping the heads off of undead monsters, you’re better served by one of the many other zombie games on the market.  Though some might be turned off by this minimization of traditional gameplay, it works well in the context of the game. The effect you have on the world is fairly minimal by design, mixing together Telltale’s point-and-click adventure game style with a smattering of quick-time events and choice-driven dialogue. This amorphous take on gameplay works very well to make you feel like you’re a part of the world, without allowing you to go too far off the rails. But just because you’re not allowed to stray too far off the beaten path, doesn’t mean you don’t have an actual influence--on the contrary, your words and actions actually play an integral part in crafting the world.  Incredibly strong writing and voice-acting give the narrative the spotlight it deserves. The vast majority of the characters you interact with are well-developed, and it’s hard not to feel compassion for even the meanest of the bunch, making you actually care about who you foster relationships with and who you choose to disappoint. What’s more, your actions have an impact not just on the events that you encounter, but in how people treat you. Don’t back up Kenny when his son is accused of being bitten, and he might not have your back a few episodes later when you need him to. Side with Lilly when she’s trying to ration the food, and she might respect you enough to help you in the coming episodes.  Your choices, both large and small, have repercussions, and can change the course of the remaining episodes--even if it’s only a slight shift. Split-second choices made later in the game can rewrite how people react to you regardless of how you’ve treated them up to that point, making each and every action all the more important. Inaction, too, is usually an option, amplified by the inclusion of a timer that makes it possible to completely miss a chance at making a decision, forcing you to sit on the sidelines and watch whatever your indifference hath wrought.  These decisions wouldn't be as emotional if it didn’t feel like there was something on the line, but there is: Clementine. The hopelessness of the world would be infectious if not for her constant optimism, giving you something to fight for. She’s slow to adapt to the fact that good and evil are now meaningless, and her innocence keeps the concept of hope alive in the survivors. More importantly, it makes it harder to justify going against what you think is truly “right,” since you know you’re going to have her big, sad eyes staring up at you. It’s heartbreaking and motivational, inspirational and depressing.  The Walking Dead’s success isn’t in creating a Choose Your Own Adventure game with hundreds of possible outcomes and limitless plotlines. Instead, it reflect the reality of life, reminding you that many of the choices you’re given have predetermined outcomes, and some things simply can’t be changed. And yet, this undermining of everything that makes The Walking Dead unique is arguably its greatest triumph. Despite not always being in control, The Walking Dead makes you feel as though you are. Even though you can’t always save someone from death, you can give it your best try, shaping the person you are. And it’s up to you to decide if it’s worth the effort to change what, in all likelihood, can not be changed.   Sure, you can replay it to see what else would happen, but that won’t change anything. It won’t change that you’re not going to leave The Walking Dead happy. You’ll feel like you made mistakes. You’ll feel like you could have done better, if you gave it another go. At best, you’ll leave without any regrets, knowing that you did the best you could do. The Walking Dead deals in a spectrum of emotion that few other games dare to take on, and it does so with aplomb. It’s utterly triumphant, crafting a narrative that proves the power of the medium by embracing what makes it unique, leading to one of the most memorable gameplay experiences ever created.","hours":195.4}

A story which will bring my emotions and reflect back to me. I had The Walking Dead in my library for 2 years but i felt it's not like what i love to experience. Like how Life is Strange is. But after watching just a glimps of Clem and Lee i started to play this. So this is how it is. Let me share my share thoughts on just few aspects.  10/10, An emotional story of distressful persons with scary theme - Aaron  Story In few words, the story was something else. I can already tell, The Walking Dead have the most painstacking and emotional story. This just tugs your heartstrings with the lovable characters. Every events that happens in the story creates more sequences. I could grope lovable arts in every moments. This actually tells perfect narration of distressful person. Things were too complex and effective to build up to the conclusion. I had my eyes open and i could see how person goes through so much effectively. This overwhelmes me every time, to see how some specific people tries to surviver and dies time by time. Also all of your choices and decisions will have minor consequence at the end. So you have to make your steps and follow the story accordingly. Overtly, The story has something more than your thoughts, something you can learn.  Gameplay Gameplay is really simplified because the creators have focused on it's story mostly. Gameplay has point and click feature which is very spontaneous and gentle. So i guess i don't grasp anything else to say.  Visuals and more The Walking Dead has absolutely simple visuals. Just seems like painting all over. In other words, different visual works than any other titles we have got. About characters, just like the visuals, painted. Tailored with simple expressions and moves.  Performance and more Have no performance issue. Running with highest presets on Intel Core i7 7700K, R9 390 STRIX and 6GB Ram and getting consolidated 60 FPS. So i would say, this is immensely perfect from this aspect.  Characters Well, this title wrought some lovely impressions of all characters. Through my journey, I would totally respect a person like Lee Everett and love a cutie pie like Clementine. Creators tailored all the characters with their stories perfectly. Like every characters had their own simple or dark stories. You might hate and love a person at the same time because of their behavior and activity. This is what i loved the most of all. Also all the characters are fabricated with perfect voices.  I'm a fan of Life is Strange franchise but have to say The Walking Dead has far better storyline than any other stories. You may not like what i just said and i'm not even gonna backpaddle. Just let your mind experience this story, you'll love it.","hours":54.1}

The Walking Dead is a game I would never forget, it is a game I incredibly love for many reasons. Out of all the Telltale Games I have played The Walking Dead would still always be my favourite, it’s not just my favourite Telltale Game maybe even my most beloved single player game that I had ever played in my life.   The Walking Dead has one of the best storylines in video game history, starting from episode 1 to 5 the story is constantly progressing, always getting better. Telltale has really nailed the storyline perfectly. With the incredibly well voice actings played out by Dave Fennoy (Lee Everett) and Melissa Hutchison (Clementine), it has really brought the the characters to life making players actually feel like they are part of the character. The atmosphere of the game changes really maturely, it's never repetitive or filled with cliches and with The Walking Dead’s sound track it greatly supports the tone and atmosphere a lot. On to the characters, this is another part which I think Telltale has also nailed perfectly. Just from the first episode already Telltale has made the protagonist Lee Everett a legend, A character that players would always remember and respect, he is also my favourite character in videogames.The second character Clementine is also one of the most beloved character in the Walking Dead series,this even makes her the main protagonist in the following up seasons, season 2 & 3 and players truly adore her. As the story progresses the characters relationship develops stronger, players feelings for the characters also builds up. I won’t be sharing any spoilers of the game but I will mention the my feeling at end of the game. There are many reasons why countless players would adore Lee Everett and Clementine and this is because of their bond together. When the game reaches the end I was so attached to the characters and the story. I cried   When I first saw this game I never expected it to be any good, because personally I am more into FPS games, and The Walking Dead was nothing close to FPS. (except for a few minor scenes you have to shoot zombies with your pistol in first person) Even though I read a lot of reviews and watched different game interviews about Telltale’s The Walking Dead, I still wasn’t convinced, but when I finally tried it myself, I completely underestimated The Walking Dead. This is a game I would 100% recommend to everyone, I don’t expect my review to be much of a help because this is a game you would have to experience it yourself to understand. My main point is to just give it a shot, you might like the game or you might not, everyone has different opinions. Its gameplay time is over 20+ hours which is incredibly well for a game priced at US$24.99, but trust me it’s worth it.  If you dont cry to the ending, I can only say one thing you're either a guy with no feelings or a cold blooded person.","hours":15.6}
{"funny_percent":0.026119402985074626,"helpful_percent":0.7595600368402449,"review":"The Walking Dead is an episodic interactive story adventure developed and published by Telltale Games based on The Walking Dead comic book series. The game consist of five separate chapters which we released spread out across 2012.   The game takes place shortly after the start of a zombie apocalypse in the US state of Georgia. Most of the characters are all unique to the game. You play the role of a university professor, who is also a convicted murderer. You rescue and care for a little called called Clementine.   Very much unlike other adventure games, there is hardly any puzzle solving to be found in The Walking Dead; it focuses mainly on the story and character development and relationships. The story is heavily effected by dialogue choices and actions taken during quick time events - these choices will often lead to game altering changes such as a character being killed off etc. All of the choices and events from one episode are carried over onto the next. I have also leaned since completing the game; that Telltale actually tracked the choices made too, and helped them to influence their writing in later episodes in the story.   You play the game mainly in a third person perspective and the camera changes depending on the scenery and objects around the player. You are constantly in communication with the rest of your group of survivors; you will build friendships, enemies and you will bond with most of the characters in someway. You will be emotionally attached to them, especially the young child, Clementine. While most of the game is also based around the dialogue, there are a number of quick time events throughout the series, normally I am not a huge fan of QTEs, but these are required in the story in order to get their point across and to at least keep you conscious of your surroundings when playing.   Graphics do not play a huge role in this game; it is by far the least important aspect to be seen. Saying that; the art style is nice and many developers should learn from this that having top of the range graphics isn't always the be all and end all for when creating a game.   The story is probably the best I have ever seen/heard in a video game; you will be drawn in from the minute you start interacting with different characters, learning about their backstory, building bonds. There are so many twists and turns in the story to keep you guessing too. By the end, if you are like me, you'll be a complete and utter emotional wreck with that the cast have gone through. This is one of the only games that has almost brought me to tears.   Since the game doesn't resolve around fast paced action other than the QTEs, there isn't any real difficulty; there is no \"wrong\" choice when it comes to dialogue, you are free to let the story develop however you choose.   Each of the chapters level design are so well thought out; there are tons of objects to interact with, pick up and use with you in future situations. If it is of any interest; then you will be able to do something with it. The art style really gets across how doomed the civilized world is in the ruined remains of cities and towns.   I have run through The Walking Dead two times now; my first play through was back when it originally came out during the sporadic release of the episodes, and just recently when I played through them all in a big binge. It is very rare that I want to play through a game again a second time; and The Walking Dead offers exactly the same excitement the second time around; you make different choices allowing the story to change and adapt to them. The whole game takes about fourteen hours to get through all of the chapters; so you are looking at a really good length game/story too.   The game can be played using a controller too - which is a nice touch given that this is the perfect sort you could play while sitting back on the sofa and soaking up the story. I also had no other technical problems while playing.   Most people already have The Walking Dead; and most will probably have already played it given it's age now. But this is a genre defining game that has brought the adventure games right back to the forefront of PC gaming. You need to experience this heart wrenching tale. Even if zombies aren't your thing; you will get emotionally hooked from the get go. Do your self a favor and play this masterpiece.

I was worried about it going in that it would focus too much on random zombie action and take away from WHY we love the Walking Dead. We like it because it actually has story and character development. Not just random gore. The game is a point and click adventure. If that's not your type of game wait for the crappy FPS coming out soon. (That I'll still probably play.) The timed decisions mechanic is a great move from the developers. Only have seconds to make a split choice really ripens the tension and panic of your situations. On top of that the game has a lot of content. 5 full episodes that can be a couple hours each to finish, with different paths and outcomes depending on how your handle things.

I have to admit that my eyes got wet after finishing main story. Sadly i can't say the same about DLC, which was short, not actually shocking, very predictable and most important - lil' bit boring. Not sure what thoughts did they have while making the DLC, but i am sure that none of the REAL Walking Dead fans liked it at least in a half like main game. That DLC was just too short to even feel a bit of the atmosphere. Can't say it about Lee's story - which gave me a lot of intense feelings.  If i had to rate the game, i would give it: The Walking Dead - 10/10 (honestly, it is the best game i ever played). DLC? I'm giving it 5/10, just for having \"The Walking Dead\" in the title.","hours":14}

This game focuses on interactions with other characters, developing loves and hates, enemies and friends along the way. Unlike the Walking Dead: Survival Instinct game, this one IS NOT a shooter, and actually has fairly little fighting of any kind.   Definitely worth the buy. I highly, HIGHLY recommend this game!","hours":9.9}
{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.8429884793728581,"review":"Telltale have made a game in The Walking Dead that helps redefine the Point & Click genre and bring into a more modern era. Alongside that they've truely mastered the art of 'choice'. Many games have attempted to bring the player choice and consequences, but few have managed to do it with great success. Most of the time the player is left with Ending 1 or Ending 2 even though they made 100 'crucial' choices throughout the game.  The Walking Dead, however, manages to really make the player feel that their choices matter, if not only in the game than morally and emotionally too. It achieves this by having a very story driven game that is supported by some of the best characters in a computer game. Characters that you don't really like (by design) due to their very human faults and personal baggage, yet as the journey progresses you become fond of them - they become part of your group. That's when you know Telltale have you hooked in.   They manage to pull off The Walking Dead dynamic far greater, and with more ease, than the TV show has ever achieved in 3+ seasons (to date). Sure, computer games have the benefit of having no real watershed or TV Regulations to censor it's content; yet that's not what makes The Walking Dead game effective.  It's the high emotion dialect, the interaction between the characters and the observations you make as Lee (... and you will find yourself becoming Lee). All of this happens as a great underplayed soundtrack supports the drama, which at times pays a little tribute to previous Zombie Movie music (such as the electronic throbs of Dawn of the Dead's music).   When I look back I find no real fault in The Walking Dead, as long as you're aware of what you're letting yourself become a part of. This isn't an action game - it's one of the best emotionally driven interactive stories you will play. It's very easy to see why this game won so many awards in 2012.   So if you're a fan of strong characters, story driven gameplay, or are perhaps intrigued at the prospect of a modernised 'Point and Click' adventure then you should check out The Walking Dead. The good news is that you'll be able to play all 5 Chapters of Season 1 today, which will put you in a good place for Season 2 (which will hopefully be released early 2014). The bad news is... you'll have to wait for the drip feed of each chapter in Season 2 to be released...","hours":16.2}

Story telling at its finest, superb voice acting, this game draws you in from the very beginning and doesn't let go. Without a doubt, the most invested I've ever been with characters making those intense scenes even more emotional.   Don't want to spoil it for those who haven't played yet (why haven't you played it already?

{"funny_percent":0.045454545454545456,"helpful_percent":0.6637457775274692,"review":"About the Game  The Walking Dead game is a telltale game that tells the story of a man named Lee who is on his way to prison for committing a murder. The trip takes an unexpected turn as his life turn into a living hell.  Storyline/Gameplay  Just like it's TV series counterpart. The Walking Dead game is not about killing zombies. There is barely an action in the game. TWD focuses more on the psychological effect of a world crisis into the human mind. The game will handle mostly about frustrations and being smart. You could say this game involves a lot of puzzle-like gameplay utilizing what's around to survive. The puzzles aren't that hard but it might be tricky for some and it can get really boring and repetitive.   Mechanics  \"This game is taillored by how you play.\" True and false. This is very misleading. Although changes are made when you pick different choices in the end it will go back to the linear storyline and proceed accordingly without taking your choices into account. From time to time, you'll see \"<name> will remember that\" but they do not have an impact to the game. The same thing basically happens just different dialogues.  Graphics  The Walking Dead series gives off a thrilling atmosphere despite having intentional cartoonish textures and low-poly models. But overall, how the entire world and character are designed makes this game really good overall.  Final thoughts  Although I gave mostly of the bad points in this game, I still recommend you to buy it especially with a discount. The story can really live an impression to some people and you might enjoy the horrific adventure.","hours":14.8}
{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.7934393173650477,"review":"This game is awesome, nothing less.  I got 18hs straight playing it, just cannot stop until finish, through a really good and very tense narrative and different action/gameplay style who puts you in the middle of difficult decisions, which have direct impact on what's going on next.  You have not always the time to think about, just react, but if your reactions are bad you can have troubles now or after, consequences brought by your decisions. And just like on real life, some of them you will have to carry with you until the end of story.  Although you have to follow a lot of dialogues, more than real action, you cannot simply sit down and think, most of times. You have to be ready to act or make decisions, so you just stare at the screen, and not rarely you can feel you're really there, a deep immersion factor.  Soundtrack is decent, matching the tension. Graphics are wonderful, and history too. I can see just two problems about that game:  You can lost a split second, confusing by the controls, and sometimes it's lethal. The good news is that although the game have not a better save system than autosave, if you die on the middle of an action scene the autosave brings you exactly at the point you died.  Also, the game have a lot of replay value, if you think you can have different decisions to make and different things to handle according on how you act before. But the game needs a way to skip some cut scenes or even dialogues faster, for those who previously finished.  One of the best and imaginative games i've ever played.","hours":23.8}

Characters are simply amazing, ambient, story, plot...this is simply a game where you care about certain characters and what will happen with them. What an amazing character Lee was, while playing it there's definitely that TV Show series feeling. Definitely look into playing this, you won't regret buying it. One more thing to note, if you're getting the game, also consider getting that DLC story extension, it's really worth it.   BAD Nothing really bad with it at all but one thing, once you finish it do not but do not start playing it again, because most of choices are leading towards the same consequences, that's what I realized while replaying it and I stopped replaying it because of that.","hours":13.8}

The man despite the fact that the game can be completed in little more than 10 hours can really bind strongly to the characters. Dedication, fear, mutual aid, quarrels, the joy of trivial things etc. I think playing shows all the possible emotions of people posed in such a situation. The diversity of our comrades characters differ greatly. Some of you may not like, but overall a really polished game. The graphics in this game is not the most important, and this line not everyone can appeal to, but I think it's really cool it looks as a whole. As someone got hold of the devaluated on Steam did a good step. In terms of story, the game for me is in second place when it comes to the game in general. The game really moves and the final scene almost brought me to tears. I would recommend! 9.5 This assessment perfect for this game.","hours":8.8}
{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.9463759779980796,"review":"This game is probably listed high on my list of games I have played.  The whole games is a development of story and character. The sole purpose as being the player is to make the decision that could mean a multitude of different events. Either a character dies. A character does not listen or heed your advice anymore. You become their leader or you become the hated individual. This whole game is built solely on the premise that the player makes the decision through point and click. Whether conversation dialogue or quick time events, it is up to the player to decide which way he will go. Kind of like those \"choose your own adventure books\" where you jump to a certain page in the book to see what your decision brings.  I have never watched the Walking Dead TV show but this game made me want to start. I thought the story and the plot around Clementine and your decision as Lee to protect her made this a compelling character dynamic and plot. It makes you the player feel relevant in the events and your decisions, which makes the point and click experience more compelling and an improvement from previous point and clicks I have played, where puzzles and story were linear.  This game made me a fan of Telltale and led to me playing others from the developer. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good story and character development and other games by Telltale.","hours":13.6}
