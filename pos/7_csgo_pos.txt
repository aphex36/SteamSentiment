{"funny_percent":0.04945054945054945,"helpful_percent":0.7202238791640039,"review":"PT-BR  Há quase 12 anos um mod de Half-Life surgia na rede desencadeando uma nova mania. Lan houses ficavam entupidas de jogadores que passavam horas jogando Counter-Strike. Quem nunca aqui virou a noite nos chamados corujões? Mais de uma década depois, CS está de volta na versão Global Offensive. E o game, por mais que seja uma cara nova pra um velho conhecido, já me deixou com vontade de chamar os amigos pra virar a noite jogando mais uma vez.  CS: Global Offensive não muda muita coisa em relação ao CS: Source ou o Counter-Strike 1.6 que todos devem conhecer. Ainda usando a Source Engine, mas dessa vez com os gráficos atualizados. Mais bonito e com uma interface atualizada, o game não tem nenhuma novidade. As armas são quase todas as mesmas e os modos de jogo se resumem aos mapas DE, de Defuse, aonde os terroristas devem plantar uma bomba, e CS, de resgatar os reféns. Logo de cara ao jogar, me deparo com velhos conhecidos. Mapas clássicos como DE_Dust, DE_Aztec, CS_Italy e DE_Inferno ganharam uma cara nova. Todos mais realistas, mas sem perder os layouts e as formas de jogar conhecidas. A portinha na Aztec por exemplo continua sendo um lugar muito perigoso.  Fora os modos clássicos, uma arma nova chamou atenção. Chamada de Zeus, é um taser de um único tiro. Pra que matar na faca se você pode descarregar alguns milhares de volts no CT mais próximo? Outras duas novidades foram as granadas. A granada decoy é a mais barata da lista e não faz nada, senão enganar o inimigo de que alguma coisa pode explodir bem próximo. Já o Molotov é uma bomba que ao explodir deixa uma área do chão em chamas, causando dano a todos os jogadores que pisarem por ali. Bem útil para corredores pequenos e portas.  Também foram adicionados dois modos de jogo bem parecidos. O Arms Race é uma corrida em que ganha o primeiro jogador a matar um adversário com cada arma do jogo. Sem times, é um estilo de jogo nos moldes de um Deathmatch. Já Demolition é outro modo parecido em que os jogadores começam com as melhores armas do jogo e a cada sucesso ao matar um adversário, ele vai recebendo armas progressivamente mais fracas até o desafio final com a faquinha.  Outra novidade é com relação aos bots. Além de mais inteligentes agora enquanto você espera o fim de uma partida, você pode assumir o controle de um dos bots. Bom pra quem quer entrar na ação rapidamente e não quer ficar esperando o jogo acabar. Muito útil naquelas partidas online em que o time adversário inteiro resolve campear. Os menus também foram simplificados pra compra de armas. Agora ao invés de 8 categorias diminuíram para 6: pistolas, SMGs (submetralhadoras), rifles, heavy (armas pesadas como shotguns e metralhadoras), gear (equipamento) e granadas.  O sistema de matchmaking facilita bastante a procura de servidores. Em nenhum momento tive que esperar mais do que alguns segundos para encontrar um servidor de baixa latência dentro do modo de jogo que procurava.  Pra quem procura um jogo novo, CS Global Offensive pode decepcionar um pouco, mas, pra quem está buscando algo familiar e passar boas horas jogando um upgrade do velho conhecido, CS:GO pode ser uma bela escolha. O game está disponível por US$ 14,99 (aprox. R$ 31) na Steam para PC e Mac, como também para Xbox 360 e PS3 na Live e PSN respectivamente.  EN  Almost 12 years ago a Half-Life mod appeared in the net triggering a new mania. Lan houses were clogged with players who spent hours playing Counter-Strike. Who never here turned the night in the so-called owls? More than a decade later, CS is back in the Global Offensive version. And the game, no matter how new it is to an old acquaintance, has already made me want to call friends to spend the night playing one more time.  CS: Global Offensive does not change much about CS: Source or Counter-Strike 1.6 that everyone should know about. Still using the Source Engine, but this time with the updated graphics. More beautiful and with an updated interface, the game has nothing new. The weapons are almost all the same and the modes of play boil down to Defuse's DE maps, where terrorists must plant a bomb, and CS, to rescue the hostages. As soon as I play, I come across old acquaintances. Classic maps like DE_Dust, DE_Aztec, CS_Italy and DE_Inferno have gained a new face. All more realistic, but without losing the layouts and known ways of playing. The door in the Aztec for example remains a very dangerous place.  Apart from the classic modes, a new weapon caught attention. Called of Zeus, it is a taser of a single shot. Why kill on the knife if you can unload a few thousand volts at the nearest CT? Two other novelties were the grenades. The decoy grenade is the cheapest on the list and does nothing but fool the enemy that something can explode very close. Molotov is a bomb that explodes leaving an area of ​​the ground burning, causing damage to all players who step there. Very useful for small hallways and doors.  Two very good game modes have also been added. The Arms Race is a race in which the first player wins to kill an opponent with each weapon of the game. Without teams, it's a style of play in the shape of a Deathmatch. Demolition is another similar way in which players start with the best guns in the game and with each success by killing an opponent, it gets progressively weaker weapons until the final challenge with the knife.  Another novelty is with regard to bots. In addition to being smarter now as you wait for the end of a match, you can take control of one of the bots. Good for those who want to get into the action quickly and do not want to be waiting for the game to end. Very useful in those online matches in which the entire opposing team decides to win. The menus were also simplified to buy weapons. Now instead of 8 categories decreased to 6: pistols, SMGs (rifles), rifles, heavy (shotguns and machine guns), gear (equipment) and grenades.  The matchmaking system makes it much easier to find servers. At no point did I have to wait more than a few seconds to find a low-latency server within the game mode I was looking for.  For those looking for a new game, CS Global Offensive may disappoint a bit, but for those who are looking for something familiar and spending good hours playing an old-fashioned upgrade, CS: GO can be a beautiful choice. The game is available for $ 14.99 on Steam for PC and Mac, as well as for Xbox 360 and PS3 on Live and PSN respectively.","hours":2018.4}

You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own.  Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fu­ck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP.  You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b.  Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods.  You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'.  You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO.

Another night of Insomnia.   I sit up in my bed, and listen to the soft hum of my Radeon™ HD 7870 GHz Edition, as her fans slowly cool the surface of her brilliant silicon plates. The only light in this room comes from the electric blue glow of my keyboard, and the azure LEDs in my Razer Abyssus.  I press a button, and the display of a 23 inch, 1080p IPS monitor lights up, colors shifting and changing in psychedelic pattens, chromatic waves of light bluring and stabilizing to send an image within my mind.   My desktop stares back at me; the only icon the Recycle bin. I move my eyes to the Taskbar, where the icons for Windows Explorer, Star Citizen, Mozilla Firefox, and lastly Steam return my gaze.  I click on Steam, and watch as a loading bar appears. The light from the moniter shines brilliantly on my face, and if I look closely into it, I can see myself reflected in the crystal surface, eyes staring deep into a mad realm of pixels and insomnia.  Steam finally loads. Oh, what's this? There's a sale on? Ah, too bad; I only have one cent in my wallet. I click the library tab in a futile attempt to find meaning.  My list of games appears, showing me hints of open doors into new worlds, strange and wonderful. What path sould I choose? Should I join battle with Dragons, in the strage land of the Nords? Or, perhaps, I should launch the StarCitizen hangar module, and lust after a dream of flight, a game not yet finished.  Ah, but here it is; Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. How many hours have I thus spent within you, oh CS:GO? You have been the reason for many nights without sleep, many days of ragequits, many days of fun and sadness. I pull out a calculator from somewhere on my desk: dividing one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-five hours by twenty-four tells me that I've been within this game for seventy-eight point five days so far. Damn.  The game begins loading, and I hear the soft hum of GPU fans, and the silent sound of the sunrise, far beyond the single window of my room.  _   Ah, where was I? I guess I feel alseep for a second there. Skip the intros, enter main menu, searc- Wait, what? 20 friends online? But, it's like 6 am... Oh, right, timezones. Eh, I might as well invite all these people.  Well, I guess I didn't want to play with them anyway. Green light fills my room, I press accept, and wait for the ninth player. Who, it seems, never can figure out what the big glowing green button actually means. Oh well, it just found another match anyway.  Well, third time's the chram, right? I guess not. Fourth time does it, and we're away. Cue loading screen, begin meaningless text I've seen only a few thousand times before.  I get up, walk towards the kitchen, and only trip twice on miscellaneous paraphernalia in the dark hallways. The bleak windows of the room greet me: pale dawn, gray clouds and black trees visible through their panes. The neon numerals of the microwave tell the time as 6:07. I search the pantry and refr!gerator, but find nothing of value.  I lower my standards and try again, this time coming up with a few tastless cookies of some kind. I begin a pilgrimage to whence I came.  The last stars of night grow cold and die; as color once again spreads over the sky. Monitor glow, winter snow, cybernetic flow.  My quest now complete, with prize in hand, I return to my chair. 0's and 1's stream across a fiberoptic gulf of space, connecting people hundreds of miles apart in a beautiful lattice of data, all for my enjoyment. I begin the first round, and purchase a FN Five-Seven and a Flashbang grenade.  I move over to long A, and hold my sights on the old wooden doors. An insurgent sprints through the open door, firing his Glock-18 as fast as he can, his bullets hitting the wal beside my head.  I pull the trigger, a volcanic plume of hot gas propelling a one gram lead alloy projectile at twice the speed of sound into the side of his head; The FN 5.7×28mm armor piercing round delivering a fatal 540 Joules of energy. The neon Stattrak™ display mounted on the left side of my Case Hardened Five-Seven increases by one, and a bright flare from the muzzle reflects its light in the cold metal of a name tag, the words \"NOT ON MY WATCH\" silently mocking those fools who fall by my pistol, in an absurd pun about clocks.  Another Terrorist moves into view, I fire three supersonic rounds into his chest, and one in his skull. Again the neon numbers shift and rearrange in a mad dance, as bullets enter my manly chest hair and are absorbed.  A third Terrorist fires, and I die in the gameworld, madly shooting as my bullets hit empty space. Pixels shift and change in an algorithmic song, and my teammates finish what I began, with the severing of a red wire a small number one is added in blue to the top of my screen.  Second round, man. Time to roll. I got long- wait, why are two of you going there? Nevermind, I'll hold Catwalk.  _   Turns out they decided to rush Mid with pistols. Poor choice. I leap out of catwalk into mid as they rush the doors, electric blue pathways of fire traversing the void between my tazer and and the insurgent's back. He screams in death as I drop the now-useless tazer and unholster a Bizon SMG; 9mm rounds begining to sputter at 320 meters per second into the backs of my foes as a Terrorist pulls a 180 and flicks a round into my skull with his CZ-75 Automatic, punching through my helmet into the flesh beneath. I mutter to myself \"I ♥♥♥♥ing hate that gun\" while typing out \"#TAZED ♥♥♥♥♥\" in all chat.  Childish insults fly like eagles, soaring over skies of wire and valleys of silicon to majestically land in the lower right of my vision, proclaiming their wondrous messages for all to see. \"get rekt\" \"u suck\" \"TIME to die, amirite\"  Using the mighty power of a pistol save round, the enemy gains a round.  From far beyond my drywall cube, a sun the color of a Helium discharge tube bleeds the first light of Autumn into a sky the color of Krypton: but here I am safe from its incandescent fingers, here, the persistance of color exists in the 60hz of my monitor. Perhaps tomorrow will be different? Oh, but I don't think it will.  The scoreboard moves with its own hateful volition, seemingly granting rounds with a heart of cinder and magma. Chaos lies within its eyes.  Final round of the first half begins and I press f1 to auto buy, supplanting my XM1014 from the previous round with an M4A4 Bullet Rain, tastefully decorated with a \"REKT\" holographic sticker and renamed \"Clockwork Ass♥♥♥♥ing\". I once again reflect on what a stupid name that is, and regret selling my Desert Eagle Blaze to buy it.  Surprisingly, my team manages to hold a push at long. In the simultaneous push to cat a rain of lead from a thundering sky finds my face with magnetic precision, and in the downtime I skim through my Ebook library on my phone. I've been considering writing something in the style of Neuromancer or Ready Player One for awhile now, perhaps if I can find the right subject... Oh well, that's a project for another day. Translation: never.  Halftime, and the tally stands at ten for them and five for us. I've seen worse. I've seen better too, but what the hell, this isn't hopeless yet.  Pistol round begins and I buy Dualies, partly just to ♥♥♥♥ with people and partly because for reasons that I can neither explain nor defend I'm ridiculously good with them. Don't dis my Dualie skills, man. Just accept it. Like a wizard and his wand: you do not choose the Dualies, the Dualies choose you.  I pop smoke Mid and rush Catwalk, suddenly realizing I hit the character limit while subsequently breaking the 4th wall.  I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 6:34, am. Damn. Another night of Insomnia.","hours":3234}

{"funny_percent":0.043531575720416923,"helpful_percent":0.8078843249595804,"review":"In this game you are a Terrorist or elite Counter-Terrorist who has never fired a gun in their life before a round starts. You must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies. Strangely, each character has the mysterious power to fire one or two shots without ridiculous recoil by very briefly jerking in the opposite direction they are moving in.   When your character wears a Kevlar vest, every part of your character, except the head, are made out of steel. Therefore, the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head. This can be annoying at first, but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a character's body.   The Goddess of Guns can materialize guns in your character's hands a few seconds before a round starts. However, your character must pay for the guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have the right amount of money, the Goddess will flash a menu in your character's eyes, allowing them to select the guns they want. More advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money.  Maps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places. Vandalism is a very serious crime in the Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists are deployed to stop them. Unfortunately for the Terrorists, they are dumb and only packed one bomb. However, the Counter-Terrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb, so the Terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend.  In some maps, the terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and low-level desk jockey in a building. The Counter-Terrorists have been deployed to save one, not both, of the hostages. In reality, this is just a thinly-veiled excuse for the CTs to murder the Terrorists while pumping rounds into the invincible hostages. One weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a \"Hostage Rescue Kit\", which somehow makes gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second. Perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your character's shoulders.   Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on Earth. Even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with Parkinsons Disease, you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic. It's worth picking up.","hours":19.7}
