Fun to play, tons of things to do, bosses to kill, ofc it has multiplayer so you can enjoy everything with friends, items to farm, a lot of stuff and decorations to build with, not to mention that if you hit the bottom and feel like you have completed the game, you can install some mods adding a crazy amount of new features, items, ect ... When you're ingame (and I don't really know how to explain it) there's just something very chilling about it, maybe it's the music, maybe it's just every little detail about it. That's just how the game works. Perfect for chilling when you had a bad or exhausting day, but it's also the perfect entertainment for your free time. 10/10","hours":326.5}

It's ability to make people gravitate back to it after an update is very nice. Speaking of updates, the developers release amazing and wholesome updates from time to time. I really recommend this game for mainly two reasons, it has a great replay ability were you just keep making worlds and playing it over and over again. The other reason is that you can do a lot of stuff with the world. From making giant houses and contraptions to attempting to kill a boss multiple times, it is a fun game. But it is also multiplayer which is a great addition. Playing by yourself can get boring sometimes but when I play this game with my friends, I just can't stop playing. I really recommend this game, it is definitely worth the 10 dollars.","hours":1074.9}

I first bought this Game back in 2013 and after dying a couple of times I didnt touch it for a while. However after playing it with a friend I discovered what a gem it really is.  Terraria is a 2D Adventure, Survival, Crafting Game that is just perfect in every way. It also is very optimised and recieved lots of updates making building (Thank you for the smart Cursor) & moving around the world (Thank you for the different mounts) alot easier.  Terraria is so Cheap but you can spend so much time on it. It basically is never ending fun and now with the achievements it will be easy ish to get 100%. The only grinding bit will be the fishing quests you'll need to do.   There is honestly so much to do and it is an absolut gem. You just have to try it out yourself and if you dont want to spend 10€ (which is already really cheap for this kind of game) then you can always wait for a sale and grab it there!  Now this Game might not have the best \"graphics\" but it is lovely the way it is and it shouldn't be in any other way.   I highly recommend this Game to any Minecraft, Metroidvania & 100% Achievement Fan. But even if you are not one of those, the Chances that you will dislike this Game are very low!

This is the sort of game that you boot up thinking you'll spend an hour or two on, only to one day wake up face down on your keyboard surrounded by bottles and plates wondering where the past 3 weeks went. 100 hours in and I've still not defeated the current 'final' boss, something that's a mixture of the games' excellent difficulty curve, and a melancholy realisation that once I defeat him, my time with the game will naturally come to an end.   Primarily, Terraria is a sandbox game. You appear in a new world with some basic equipment and no real instruction, eventually you will build a small house to survive the monsters that surface during the night, discover some form of corruption eating away at the world, encounter new NPCs and face off against powerful Boss enemies. Despite all this, you are given little direction, these are merely facets of a larger game that allows players to do as they wish, encountering all the world has to offer at mostly their own pace. Part of the great design behind the title is in the difficulty curve I mentioned earlier, meaning challenges pitted against a player start easy and steadily increase at a rate easy to handle. Although traditional RPG elements are largely absent, a discrete levelling system is present in the form of Bosses that have been defeated, meaning if you don't progress through these enemies then the gameplay doesn't become more difficult. In fact, the first boss doesn't spawn until you're suitably equipped with armour and health.   My hours in the game are split roughly equally between single and multiplayer. Single player stands up on its own perfectly fine, but in my opinion the game is much more rewarding gathering some friends and working together to tackle the bosses, as the feeling of reaching new goals is shared, and the ammount of 'grinding' for materials is spread across multiple people. It also helps to appreciate the brilliant soundtrack, as if you voice chat with your group then spontaneous humming along loudly is to be expected.   Enemy design is exciting and unique, with floating eyes, possessed suits of armour, giant robotic worms, and a ninja suspended in a giant ball of slime all making appearances. That being said, whoever on the design team is responsible for 'hellbats' has earned a special sort of hatred from myself...  All in all Terraria is an amazing experience from beginning to end, its tone is humourous at times whist still provoking a feeling of wonderment and mystery in its exploration, and fearful excitement at its combat. It's a game I will come back to time and time again looking to recapture the memories I've made, and to forge new ones. It is a rare game in that with no shred of a doubt, these hours I have spent were not wasted. I heartily recommend that you purchase this game.   Fortune and glory kid...  ","hours":113.1}

{"funny_percent":0.09055118110236221,"helpful_percent":0.8900039939502972,"review":"This review applies to Terraria 1.3.0.8 and earlier.  The essence of Terraria is that it prioritizes fun! It's not a game where players must fear losing progress due to forgetting safety measures or manage breakable tools. The game knows how to bring out a sense of enjoyment and achievement. Grinding is an option, not a requirement or an excuse to drag out game time. Besides, there is much to discover and do in the game. Clocking in at 1,000+ hours, having all 88 achievements, and introducing multiple friends to the game should be indicative of that. With that being said, I'll list some pros/cons I've found memorable.  Pros Customization: There is a staggering amount of customization available in-game. You not only can choose from several basic character designs but also have a plethora of armors, costumes, accessories, and pets for your character. You can also color/dye any of your equipment and get all sorts of flashy effects. Dyes aren't consumable, so you have few restrictions on perfecting your assemblage. Exploration: The Terraria world may be finite, but it is incredibly diverse. Each biome has its own personality and houses many unique elements. It takes a minimum of three worlds to discover everything, and that's only with absurd luck (see \"The Creation of the Guide\" painting). The game additionally has an impressive number of flavor. That rubble on the ground can be dug up, and a Worm might pop out from it. You can reignite the burnt-out Campfire in that small cavern. You didn't think that NPCs could fend for themselves during a Blood Moon or invasion, did you? Just when you think you've learned everything about the Terraria world, you discover something surprising. Creativity: Terraria is as much as about creating your world as it is exploring it. Blocks and furniture are not just for aesthetics, but they also introduce some neat mechanics. Players looking to engineer stuff will enjoy the contraptions possible by the wiring mechanic, and designers will love being able to paint the overworld with a wide spectrum of colors. Terraria features innovative design at its finest. Progression options: Like any good RPG, there's a great sense of progress made in a playthrough. You mine or slay enemies for the materials needed to upgrade equipment, and the world is bountiful enough that this progress never feels linear or constrained. Even the achievements flow nicely, never feeling too easy, cheap, or absurdly difficult. You never need to rely crutch items to make progress. Rather, in my experience, my friends and I frequently had too many options and had to reluctantly store away some of our neat loot. There is always something to switch to if a playstyle becomes easy or repetitive. Balance: A game can become boring if there is a certain playstyle players fall into. Terraria manages to find the right balance so that all playstyles have a fair shot at completing the game. There is no bottleneck or singular Infinity+1 Sword needed for progress. Diversity: Terraria promotes itself as a game for any type of player, and that claim certainly has truth in it. The game has gameplay suited for battlers, explorers, and builders, and I can also tack on several options that appeal to other types of players. Collectors will balk at the quantity of items and achievements offered, and players can challenge themselves to make progress with nearly any conduct. Play with only melee/ranged/magic/summoning weapons? Sure. A yo-yo only run? That's popular! No crafting/mining? Certainly. Play the entire game upside-down? Of course--and that's bug-free! If that's not enough, you can fire up a world in Expert Mode for the extra challenge. There's something for everyone. I've had a friend who would ask on his first playthrough 'Can I do ____ in the game?' and I could answer in the positive the majority of the time. Just for starters, you can teleport, build trap-filled dungeons, set up PVP minigames, and record the soundtrack. The game's breadth is incredible. Automation: Terraria would be daunting without any form of automation. You have thousands of items, hundreds of monsters, dozens of mechanics, and an expansive world to build on or dig through. The game offers much to ease the burden of management. Auto-select picks the right tool rather than requiring manual selection. The smart cursor allows for one-click digging. Quick-stacking is much more convenient than depositing items one-by-one, chest-by-chest. Farming is not only feasible but easy. Making measured builds is simplified with items like the Ruler. The game naturally provides the player ease-of-use tools so a playthrough can be focused on the fun stuff rather than on chores. Performance: Many games fall off a prospective player's wishlist due to system requirements. Terraria is a game that features a crazy amount of sprites, particle effects, physics, lighting, and entity interaction. Being a 2-D game only nets you that much speed before optimizations come into play *cough*Starbound*cough*. The game's requirements are reasonable and the gameplay is optimized such that it doesn't require a bulky system to run on. I was able to run it decently on a 2007 year-old desktop on Windows XP with low-end specifications. The performance of the game to medium- and some low-end systems makes it accessible to a broad demographic of players. On the other hand, if you have a high-end system, go ahead and fire up that Color lighting mode and enjoy Terraria in its full glory. Quality of life: Many games have little quirks that people have to accept to enjoy. Not only is Terraria's gameplay mainly devoid of bugs, but it also buffs out these quirks. Players are separated from worlds, allowing for easy singleplayer-to-multiplayer transfer. Characters can ascend blocks without needing to jump. Chests containing items don't explode if you try to harvest them. Keys are easily remappable for those familiar with alternate control schemes. Quick-stacking skips 'favorite' items. You can use the in-game system for taking wide screenshots for giant builds. You can set player configurations to ease the smallest of annoyances. In general, you never feel you're fighting the game's controls and interface. Continued updates: It would be very easy for Terraria, as popular as it is, to offer game expansions as paid DLC. The developers, instead, make their continued updates absolutely free to owners of the game. The developer-community relationship is superb.  Cons New player friendliness: The in-game help system is stunted, and players can easily become overwhelmed by the ever-growing number of toys in Terraria's sandbox. Many people resort to a guide to help them through the game. Grinding: While the game does not require noticeable grinding to progress, several tangents in the game require patience and luck. That fancy teleportation item pretty much necessitates a farm in the Hallow. The last component of a PDA could be hundreds of monster drops or fishing quests away. At a rate of one quest per in-game day, the 200 fishing quests achievement would require 4,800 minutes (3 1/3 days) to complete without resorting to tricks. It can be frustrating to have an achievement be left incomplete as a stretch, yet Terraria is not above this issue. Moddability: Terraria is extensive enough that it doesn't need additional features, but people have been able to decode the game and develop external software and mods for a better game experience. It would be a boon if the game was open to the modding community for extended gameplay. ","hours":1132.9}

{"funny_percent":0.05555555555555555,"helpful_percent":0.9143861972980849,"review":"Terraria is one of the best indie games ever created. There is so much to do in this game and so much to collect. Even after you invest dozens of hours there will still be monsters to hunt, bosses to fight, gear to craft, materials to find, and fun to be had. Take all of that and throw in friends and you will have a blast with this masterpiece.  Gameplay: The gameplay here is very simple overall, but the deep customization is what makes it so addicting and memorable. Combat is very simple, and has three main branches that you can follow: Melee, Range, and Magic. There are various weapons, trinkets, armor, and summons that will increase the potency of your talents and allow you to achieve maximum stats. This would mean nothing of course if there wasn't a huge cast of enemies to fight and there is: there are over 400 different enemies each with its own set of drops to be obtained. Fighting isn't the only thing you'll do though, as you'll also need a powerful and invulnerable shelter to house your possessions, NPCs, and spawnpoint, all the while keeping them safe from the hundreds of various threats. The sheer amount of different blocks, background tiles, and furniture ensure that you will never build the same house twice, unless you want to of course. The mining in this game is also addictive and fun. There are so many exotic treasures to be found in the underground along with dangerous enemies and fantastic biomes. Every ground level biome has its own cave that holds its respective gear type (Ex. Snow Biome Caves have ice swords) giving you tons to explore, loot, and conquer. Once you obtain powerful enough equipment and stats, you will eventually pit yourself against the game's many bosses which are doorways for new loot and new phases for your world to undergo. There is an unbelievable amount of content in this game and it all fits together so well. Considering the fact that this game will continue to be updated after the release of its sequel is a guarantee of the developer's hard work and consideration for the strong and ever growing community.  Overall Score for Gameplay: 10/10  Story: The story in this game is extremely minimal and more left to the speculation of individuals. What is certain is that your in a post apocalyptic type world that is overrun by deadly creatures and being taken over by evil and corruption. As you explore and upgrade your equipment you'll develop the world into a safer and pure place that the friendly NPCs can inhabit easier. In short, your a kind of guardian standing against the tide of evil that looks to spread throughout the world and consume it. While there are some interesting tidbits given to you by the NPCs as to why your there and what your doing, they don't add too much. Fortunately, this game doesn't need a canon story to be good and is open enough for players to speculate what they think the game is about allowing them to create their own stories, which is really what makes this gem so special.  Overall Score for Story: 9/10  Characters: The characters in this game are simply crafted, each NPC has its own personality but they aren't developed in any meaningful way and stay pretty much the same throughout the playthrough which is fine as their main purpose is to sell you goods. They are however pretty diverse and have enough character for the player to speculate them which fits in with the rest of the story nicely.  Overall Score for Characters: 8/10  Graphics: The graphics in this game fit the theme and overall feeling very well. The biomes are very different looking from one another, the NPCs all fit in nicely with the scenery, the building materials stand out from nature, and the particle effects are very nice. The visuals are timeless and will continue to serve this game well for many years to come.  Overall Score for Graphics: 10/10  Soundtrack: The soundtrack in this game is very nice and fits the mood well. Each biome has its own theme that truly brings it to life and gives it depth. Alternate music also plays for bosses which alerts the player to the rising difficulty and awards if he/she succeeds. The OST does its job very well and is definitely worth buying buy itself if your into that.  Overall Score for Soundtrack: 9/10  Sound: The sound effects in this game are great. The ambient noise such as rain or wind are convincing and really bring the locations a sense of authenticity. With the hundreds and thousands of enemies, objects, material, and weapons, you'd think they make similar sounds but they do not which really improves the overall quality of the game.   Overall Score for Sound: 10/10   So yeah, this game is really something special and can be run on a laptop from the 90s so there is no excuse from a hardware or wallet standpoint not to pick this one up. It has a ton of replay value and even after you \"beat\" it there is still plenty of fun to be had with friends. I have owned this game on Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS Vita, and now PC and I can still sink plenty of hours in and still feel like I have a lot to do.  Overall Score for Game: 9.4/10  If you have any questions about the game, comment on this review.","hours":38.6}

Life can be hard in an open world such as the one from Terraria. You could be preparing a Bowl of Soup in your new kitchen when all of a sudden an army of Goblins invade from the West. And you were not geared! They might end up killing Isis, the Party Girl, and you kinda had a thing for her, but that's okay, that's just a game. She *will respawn*.  This game consists of exploring and exploring and exploring, and while you explore you'll find new enemies, new materials or ores to craft new accessories, gear, potions, vanity item, decorations for your house.   You can set up traps, build intricate mechanism and wiring (check around Terraria Teleporter Hub). You will face pretty challenging bosses, which will throw you in the search for more powerful gear to defeat him.  And after you done it all, you'll realize that Crimson Blocks are much cooler than the blocks you used to build your main Quarter in your Base. And you will rebuild it all again.  I've found the Multiplayer pretty cool, but for that you'd need to have friends who play at the same pace as you. It is not fun if one of you got much better gear than the others.   The achievements are right on spot, apart from the \"Supreme Helper Minion\" which befits the level of a trained monkey. Devs should learn that brainless repetition is hardly a challenge.

My impression prior to buying it was that it was a 2D minecraft clone, but after playing it, I prefer it to minecraft. But comparing to minecraft, as is often done, doesn't seem very fair to me, because they are two very different experiences. Terraria can be played in many different ways, and I'd expect that most people can find a way to enjoy it. Whether you prefer to take it slowly and cautiously, farming herbs and brewing potions, or prefer to role the dice, diving through caves and looting randomly generated structures, Terraria can be about exploration, collection, boss fighting, base defending, and much more.   You start out by creating a character. The customization is limited, but not too limited. You can have multiple characters, and you can skip this by randomizing or choosing the default skin, but it doesn't take very long. You can then create a world (or multiple), choosing between normal and expert mode (as its name suggests, expert mode is not forgiving to newer players). The world has many different regions to explore, each with their own dangers and treasures. Between islands in the sky, a bug-infested jungle, a terrifying evil (which begins to spread later, there are two variants), and much more, you probably won't be bored by it for some time.  The game has many mechanics to make it interesting. You can start a town of NPCs and complete quests for them or buy goods from them. You can fish up a meal or some treasure. You can acquire tools which you can use to wire up traps or farms. There are many events the player can defend against of varying difficulties throughout the game, and even more bosses to fight. There are literally thousands of different items and accessories to customize your playstyle; although there are only four main classes to choose from for the majority of the game, these being mage, ranged weaponist, mele fighter, and summoner (although summoner items are usually more difficult to obtain).  I personally have put in almost a thousand hours, but I don't believe you need to put in even ten hours to get your money's worth. If you're having any difficulties while playing, the game has a massively helpful wiki, and a friendly community.","hours":1567.4}

Thank you. If you'd like to skip straight to Pro's & Con's, please move to the bottom of the page. Thank you.  UPDATED EDIT 7/6/2015: With the release of Update 1.3, Terraria has become three hundred times better. Update 1.3 adds in loads of new items, monsters, bosses, events, and more. The new bosses are a really big challenge and very cleverly done. The addition of achievements is addicting to any player who loves to hunt achievements, like myself. Including the new gamemode known as \"Expert Mode\" which is basically like turning the difficulty up to 'brutal'. Lots of other changes as well, like new textures and sounds, and the new addition of world stats to keep track of how many of each type of monster you kill (Which now rewards you with banners).   How I Found Out About \"Terraria\" I found out about Terraria the same way I use to always find games, YouTube. I randomly came across a video called \"Terraria\". I took a look, and instantly fell in love with what I saw, and knew I had to have the game for myself. It looked like a great combination of gerne' that I love to bits. Being a Minecraft fan since the beggining of Alpha, I knew I MUST have it.  Unfair First Impressions When ever you ask someone about Terraria, read a review, or watch a video, 95% of the time you hear \"Minecraft clone\" or \"2D Minecraft\". Which is incorrect on so many levels. If you have heard this many times, and are thinking twice about actually playing Terraria, please read on as it is nothing like Minecraft.   Review Of Terraria Terraria is a very unique game for what it does. There have been games like it in the past, but the amount of content and play ability is beyond anything I've ever seen before.   Terraria is a sandbox, RPG, action, etc. 2D game. It does it's thing very well. I haven't noticed any UI bugs, or ones that I have, are fixed almost instantly after the patch is released. The gameplay it provides is not only smooth, it is addicting and fun. The combat system in the game is perfect for me, and a lot of others. There are so many enemy types in this game that are not copy paste, each one does their own thing and has their own weaknesses & strength's   Example on the kind of enemies you could come across.  Normal walking/running enemies, that have a soul objective to charge you until death. These may include enemies like the zombie or skeleton. As there are other enemies who will do the same thing, but in a different way (So not everything is copy/paste.). Like the slime enemy type, which come in many varieties, which will bounce towards you. Or the spider enemy type, which will walk on the ground, but can also climb on the walls to get to you quicker. Just to name a few.  \"Well, how do I defend myself against these enemies?\" Good question. Let's get that.  Items & Furniture This is where Terraria gets big. Even though the world's are limited, they provide so much that you could spend 800 hours of game time on a single small world and still have many things to do.  In the world of Terraria, there are alternate versions of almost everything. What I mean by this is, each world you have will not be the same. For example, there is a 50/50 chance when loading a world to have the default version of something, or the alternate. Such as the music that plays, there are different tracks for the same biomes, just depends on what random one you got. Or for textures on things like, grass, and trees. Also things like ore, in a default world you would have Copper as your basic ore, but in an alternate world, you'd have Tin as your basic ore. What this does is really expands the play time someone can spend in Terraria. Allowing a single person to play the game over and over, and never have the same experience.   Below the surface are loads of blocks, dirts, ores, and more. Ore like Copper, Tin, Lead, Iron, Silver, Platinum, Gold, Cobalt, etc. And blocks like normal dirt, clay, stone, mud, cobwebs, and so many more. You need these ores to make your weapons and armor. You can find treasure deep underground, that holds many valuable things. You can increase your maximum health by finding Life Crystals underground.  The weapon range in this game is massive. You even have magic weapons, like spell books, and mana weapons. There are also bows, swords, pickaxes, axes, guns, lazers, cannons, familiars, and so much more.  I won't get into to much detail here, but the amount of content in this game is massive, and it's still being updated. Sure, Terraria has been through some rough times with updates, but when it gets an update, the update is full of new things and changes.   Pro's & Con's (Overall Rating) Overall, Terraria is a great game that you can spend hours of time in, and still be having fun in many years to come. It's a steal for the price of $9.99, and especially when there is a sale that lowers the game to $2.00 or less. This game is definitely a choice for sandbox gamers looking for an easy to slip into, addicting experience.   Pro's: +Loads of content for hours of game time. +Great combat system. +Smooth gameplay, that's easy to slip into. +Provides a good challenge. +Fun and creative boss battles. +Amazing side events that you cannot resist. +Achievements are addicting to those achievement hunters. +Expert & Hardcore modes add hundreds more hours of gameplay and possibility.  Con's: -No infinite world option. (Doesn't drop overall score - But can be annoying to some players) -No easy way to edit worlds before creation (Like choosing whether to have Crimson or Corruption)  Overall Rating: Is about a 14.5/15 (Must Own!)

The amount of items you can craft or get and enemies you can defeat (including bosses) is just sometimes overwhelming.  The game has 2 stages :  1) Pre-hardmode - basically a longer \"tutorial\" where you learn basics such as crafting, fighting monsters and exploring biomes, this stage ends when you kill certain boss in the underground called wall of flesh.  2) Hardmode - the real game begins here, monsters are stronger and new biomes appear, a lot of game content unlocks only in this mode. This stage remains forever (or you can count defeating the last boss as a end of it).  There are a lot of decorative items and furniture so builders won't be dissapointed though I was focused more on exploring and fighting rather than building.

Now that I've logged over 150 hours into it, I see that Terraria is so much more than Minecraft. When I tried to figure out what was better, I made a list. Hopefully, I can do this right: Exploration Terraria 2d side-scrolling Multitude of biomes to explore(Around 38) You can find loot and ore, without even going underground Minecraft 3d world Multitude of biomes to explore(Around 61) You can find loot, and bars or metal above ground as well (Minecraft Wins) Spelunking(Mining/Underground Exploration) Terraria 13 ores, plus an additional 4 ores once in hardmode Generated caves, as well as, other aspects of underground like Abandoned mineshafts, houses, temples, etc. You can dig straight down to hell! Minecraft 7 ores Generated Caves, Ravines, Mineshafts, 3 Strongholds, and Monster Spawners You can grind for obsidian, make a portal, and set it on fire to go to hell! (Terrria Wins) Crafting(Not including Weapons/Armor) Terraria Using around 38 crafting stations(including Honey,Lava, and Water) You can craft anything If you don't know what an item requires, you can ask the Guide Npc for help(See Npc) In layman's terms, you can make blocks, walls, potions, accesories, tools, torches, boss spawners(See fighting), dyes, grapple hooks, and pets, and decorations(including pots, beds, etc.) Minecraft Using 2 interfaces, a player can craft some stuff they want to(being forced to grind for the rest) If you don't know how to arrange the items on a grid, you can look it up on the wiki! In layman's terms, you can make blocks, crafting stations, torches, tools, and decorations( including pots, and beds) (Terraria Wins) Fighting Terraria There are 392 enemies in Terraria, including the bosses There are 18 bosses in Terraria.(The celestial towers were each counted separetly) You can make 15 sets of weapons and armor from the ores aforementioned. Allowing any play style.  There are guns, bows, staves, swords, sythes, summoner staves, magic guns, yoyos, spears, chain weapons, and tomes. Minecraft There are 12 enemies in minecraft, including the bosses. There are 2 bosses in Minecraft You can make 4 sets of armor, with 1 of them being leather and not metal. You can make a bow, and 5 swords (Terraria Wins) Npc's Terraria There are 22 Npc's in Terraria, 19 of which will move in, if you build them a house You can sell or buy from npc's and many attack enemies that are in the vicinity Minecraft There is 1 npc in minecraft(just getting reskinned a bunch to look like more) You can exchange goods in very 1 sided trades(You're gettin swindled!)

It looked like a minecraft ripoff in a 2D world. The large amount of positive reviews and the low prive (4.99 euro at that time) convinced me to give this a try.  I could not have been more wrong. This game is awesome ! The amount of content, the freedom, the difficulty level, the items and achievements you can collect, all of this make it one of the best games I have ever played.  You can: 1 Create large buildings 2 Collect loads of items, weapons and armor 3 Explore a huge map 4 Become a badass warrior and defeat enormous bosses 5 ...  One thing I really like is what changes if you play on the highest difficulty level. Ofcours everything gets a lot harder, but you are also able to get better and more drops (items) from enemies. This feels like the game is rewarding you for playing on a higher difficulty.  There is even a multiplayer aspect, which makes it even better. It is really fun to play with friends.  Graphics : 8/10 Not too impressive, a 2D world map. The graphics itself are outdated but create the perfect atmosphere for this game. You can create 2 types of worlds, which each have a different dark environment. Multiple biomes (forest, jungle, desert, ...) exist, with its own unique enemies and environment.  Optimization : 9/10 Good optimization, 60 fps on 1440p-max on a gtx 980 (overclocked) with v-sync on. Without v-sync, the fps went up to a stable 165 fps, but for some reason playing on 60 fps is more enjoyable.  Story : 2/10 This is where the game is lacking at the moment. Actually no story exists, you are free to create your own :)  Length : 10/10 I killed the final boss after 125 hours on the highest difficulty. This is awesome for a game where I payed 4.99 for. The game is not finished though. I can still perfect my house, kill other bosses, collect items, explore some more...  I have around 180 games in my steam library, after 2 weeks this game is in the top 3 of most played games. Enough said.  Replayablity : 10/10 Each world you create, is unique because they are created based upon a \"seed\". As stated above, each world has its unique dark environment. The type is selected upon world creation. There are  different type of ores, but each world will only contain . This means each world will play differently and you need to create a lot of worlds to be able to collect all the items in the game.  Because of this you will never be able to see al the content and achievements on your first playthrough.","hours":167.6}

Building/crafting is intuitive and fast albeit 2d, and the game makes for a very fun co-op experience if you have friends to play with.  At its price bracket, the value for time spent is phenomenal if you like the idea of a 2d sandbox platformer with boss fights and the excitement of the next loot drop. Difficulty scales nicely (and has an \"expert\" mode for those that find the default game a bit easy), World size is variable, and the penalty on dying can be chosen from \"drop some money and nothing else\" to \"your character is dead, please start again\".  One of the nicest features of Terraria is the ability to have characters and worlds that aren't tied to each other. So if you're looking for a specific item that doesn't seem to be on your world, you can just generate a new one, take your character there to farm for items, and then go back to your main world - or you can start a brand new character on a world you've already built up with NPCs and everything else rather than needing to completely start from scratch each time - not many games have managed to pull this off so well.  The game is also very kid friendly, and has been a fun family multiplayer game in this house many times over.  Summary  Excellent 2D platformer with crafting, boss fights, huge amounts of content from aesthetics to rare items and godly weapons, the ability to continually improve your character over hours of play, and well designed procedurally generated levels. Great single player experience, great multiplayer experience as long as you have other friends or family members to play with. Very cheap for the amount of content and game there is available.","hours":515.1}

You start off with nothing but as you discover Terraria you notice how much is in this game.  Stats  Here are some general stats about Terraria to give you an idea of how impressive this game is.  Terraria contains:  - 2748 Items - 401 enemies - 76 potions - 69 swords - 34 bows - 30 guns - 21 bosses  As you can see Terraria contains a massive collection of fun.  Gameplay  You will start off by creating your character and creating your world. A nice feature to note is that you can have your character travel through multiple worlds while keeping their items. You will be thrust into a new world where you will have to gather resources and upgrade your arsenal. Night in Terraria is not as forgiving as Minecraft. After you survive you will continue to build up your personal collection while building a house. You will build a house so that random people can move in take up a room and rip you off with prices (jk not all prices are bad). Eventually you shall fight your first boss and bosses in Terraria will give you a run for your money so you better be prepared guys and gals.   Singleplayer/Multiplayer  Terraria is a fun game and even more fun with friends. Friends will help you out and make it easier to advance without dying.... too much :D. However if you do not feel like playing multiplayer singleplayer is just as fun. In single player you do not have to share your loot and your friends are incapable of stealing it, because it is singlepalyer.  Hardmode  Hardmode is a gamemode that Terraria automatically places you in after you beat The Wall of Flesh. In Hardmode you will meet new bosses and new enemies. You will find new materials and you will quickly realize every is much tougher and you need to quickly upgrade yourself.  Rating  Pros\t + Smooth gameplay + Have not felt lag as of yet + character customization + huge amount of weapons + HARDCORE + entertaining for hours  + huge amount of armour sets with special abilities  Cons\t - a lot to grasp for a new player to Terraria (I dont think i can think of any more)  Final Thoughts  Terraria is an amazing 2D sandbox that tests you.

I met a lot of people and learned so many things through these friendships and communities and practically gone through what seems like the virtual equivalent to my childhood, so wow does this game have a special place in my heart.  Putting my sentimental values in this game aside, content-wise this game is practically everything a fantasy-loving, retro game, sandbox, adventurous and architectually creative enthusiast could ever ask for (see if you're not a fan of any of those kind of games, then you probably might not enjoy this considering the beginning is rather.. slow). Gosh there's just so much to love in this game that I don't even know where to begin, that is, if you give this game a chance. I shall warn anyone who isn't a fan of reading guides that the game in the beginning isn't very intuitive, as it just throws you in the world with no tutorial whatsoever. However there is a Guide NPC, so if you do feel lost on what to do, you should speak to said NPC. The controls of this game is pretty basic; WASD to move, space to jump, number keys corresponding to the hotbar, click to attack, etc.  But once you got all of that figured out, boy is this game one heck of a ride, especially if you haven't read any spoilers and you have absolutely no idea what will happen next in this gem of a game. You'll be quite surprised with how many things you can discover, how many things you can create and conquer; I definitely recommend you play this with friends as progression throughout the game would be so much more funner, meaning you'll get to the fun stuff faster (i.e. the events and ridiculous weapons and mounts).","hours":2625.3}

There probably isn’t much I can say which hasn’t already been said. Many gamers have heard of it, and many gamers know it is considered to be generally “great,” transcending most genre preferences and prejudices. And I now count myself among those people. But the inherent quality of Terraria isn’t necessarily that obvious when a total newcomer decides to give it a shot, as the game can be quite uninviting at first. And that is something I want to address.  So I will tell you, like the thousands of others, that Terraria is an incredibly enjoyable game. It is hard to concisely describe exactly why it is so enjoyable; but it basically boils down to the fact that there is an air of quality inherent to every gameplay aspect and those aspects synergize so well that that quality is multiplied exponentially in the end result.  But when I first decided to try it, I failed three times to get into it. Each time I sat down and tried to see what all the fuss was about, but each time I wound up extremely bored and confused as to why I couldn’t see what was supposed to be so fun about it. The lack of any clear purpose and direction at the start of the game had me running around with no real incentives, and it ended up feeling unrewarding. Then I played with some new friends online who could offer a bit of direction. We started a new world together and the next thing I knew hours had flown by and I realized that I was finally enlightened.  It was difficult to get over the initial hump of a learning curve and having a starter character. There is no tutorial, there are no objectives; simply moving around is tedious at first, the digging is slow, and the building options are minimal… and it can all feel rather boring. But when you finally start making progress into the game, all the upgrades and item-tiers you climb through feel so gratifying. And I think having that initial slow-climbing grind at the start is a major part of what makes the game so satisfying once you finally delve into the heart of it.  Once you reach this point of enlightenment, you will be eager to explore all that Terraria has to offer. Hunt down exotic loot. Fight epic boss battles. Build giant castles with thousands of items. Make new friends and enjoy the enormous replayability of playing online. Maybe even try a role-play server. There are many hours of fun to be had.  Perhaps the only negative aspects worth noting are the simplistic graphics and the lack of any clear story-mode. But due to the great gameplay and nature of the game, both of these things are easily dismissed as a non-issue by most. That said, if you really like story-driven experiences and/or gorgeous, current-gen graphics, you definitely won’t find those here.  So in short, Terraria is something that can be easily enjoyed by almost any gamer. If you haven’t yet given it a go, you should probably consider it. It is a pretty safe bet for all but the most extremely discerning gamers. Just don’t forget that it may feel boring at first, but it is worth fighting past it; and playing with some people online can make it significantly more fun, especially when you are new.
