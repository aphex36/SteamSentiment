{"review":"Have you ever noticed how, in a typical RPG (and, now that I think about it, most games in general) battles don’t really mean anything? How many times have you defeated a miniboss, only to have it stand back up and laugh at you, saying “I have underestimated you! You are a worthy opponent! This is not the end! We shall meet again!” and make a getaway? Think about it. How many times do you beat up Balrog in Cave Story only to have him fly away without a scratch? How is Black Knight able to keep running away after Shovel Knight stabs the hell out of him? How come you black out if you lose a Pokémon battle, but none of the other trainers do? And how does the big bad villain always seem to get away, even if their HP hits zero, so they can reappear in the sequel?  Undertale asks the question, “What if defeating an enemy in battle always means that they die?”  This might seem quite inconsequential in random encounters, but Undertale will also pit you against several main characters. If you defeat a main character in battle, they’re dead for good, and the whole story changes to reflect it. Heavy stuff.  But thankfully, as the game advertises, you don’t actually have to kill anyone! The game offers a second option to get out of battles: talking the enemy out of fighting. This involves solving a simple puzzle, almost always involving the “Act” menu in battle. The puzzle changes depending on what kind of enemy you’re fighting; sometimes you’ll just need to give them a compliment, other times you’ll need to survive several of their attacks, and so on. Once they’re not emotionally invested in the battle anymore, you can “spare” them, and the battle ends. You won’t get any EXP for it, but you’ll still get gold. It’s a very unique fighting mechanic!  I admit, after my first playthrough of the game, I was disappointed in the story’s presentation. I thought that both the very beginning and the final area of the game were fantastic, dripping with shocking emotional dilemmas, but the middle 80% of the game’s content seemed like it relied too much on oddball humor and not much else. The game hilariously plays with expectations and has no shortage of genuinely witty satire of its genre, and I found myself amused by nearly all of it, but after the first two hours as I was walking across long linear worlds and listening to dozens of characters try to tell me jokes, I started to wonder where the emotional gravity had gone. “Why is this game making me laugh, when I thought it was supposed to make me cry?” I asked myself. “Where are the feelings? After such an excellent and powerful prologue, why is the game taking so long to show me more?”  Later that night, as I was lying awake in bed, the answer hit me: the game was quirky and lighthearted because I was sparing everyone’s life. I wasn’t playing as a murderer. If you want this game to have drama, you have to cause it. And I think that’s where all the hype is coming from, all the talk about player choice. This is a game about being a tree-hugging pacifist, or a murderous psychopath who kills anyone who gets in the way, or anything in between. You only need to live with whomever you decide to be, because the game won’t let you ignore what you have done.  Though it isn’t the most visually impressive game, and the stage design isn’t always the best, Undertale has left me feeling that I have just witnessed a work of art. It tried some new and ambitious things and isn’t ashamed of what it wanted to be. It's about 6 hours long; I’d recommend anyone to play it at least twice, just to be able to say that they've made their own choices and seen what the game has to offer. It’s hard to imagine that anyone would regret the experience.","hours":11.7,"funny_percent":0.0763064434297311,"helpful_percent":0.9337392186707255}

{"review":"Ten dollars. Only a few hours of gameplay. 16-bit graphics compared to the flashy 1080p stuff in standard games.  But... wow. Undertale blew me away. It doesn't need flashy graphics or even fanservice to falsify its enjoyment. It just does things right, and boy that was one immensely enjoyable experience.  I think most of the magic of this game comes from knowing absolutely nothing about it. I got this game from a friend and just decided to play it since it looked very interesting and it was getting good responses. So I went in completely blind, knowing nothing but the game's name. And I'm glad I did, because everything the game presented to me was unexpected, notably dark in places, and very emotional, which would have been lost entirely if i watched someone else play it. So, if you happened to have been flooded by everything Undertale on tumblr (god help us) and the entire story's already laid out for you, the magic has been lost and the game won't be as incredible of an experience. I'm sorry.  Of course, I call Undertale an \"experience\", not a game, only because it does such a fantastic job at it. Following the motto on the store page, \"the game where you don't have to destroy anyone\", the game always tries to nudge you in that direction, taking a back seat in your mind and reminding you to \"Spare them!\". And of course, you answer with \"Why? Why should I do that when it offers me the option to kill anyone I want right in front of me? What's in it for me?\" And that's where the game literally turns into a personal experience, as everyone has a different response for the game's selling point. And boy, does it turn to black or white pretty fast from here.  Undertale's ability to completely turn the tables of its story depending on your actions is massive. Upon your game's startup, every little thing you do will be set in stone in the game's story pathing. If you're the type who immerses yourself into the game's charming music, laughs at the childish but hiliarious anctics, and is willing to hork down healing items just to prevent yourself from killing a monster just because a fight is difficult, the game rewards you. It opens up a very character-developing and world-unfolding story, along with some of the most emotionally invested boss battles I have ever experienced. You know a game is good when it breaks the fourth wall so well that you're shaking in your seat in true fear and can't stop the shivers, all while having to fight a hopelessly overpowered god of a boss. The amazing writing only starts once you beat the final few bosses, and the story doesn't stop being good from there onwards.  On the other hand, what makes this game different is that it keeps its dark side from you, and its entirely your choice to experience it. If you scoff at the game's sparing choice since you're too cool or grown up to possibly be nice to people, you can go around and intentionally sink your weapon into a monster who just wants to be a friend. And unlike many other games, this isn't just a simple moment of \"Oops, I killed another unnamed enemy, let's reset the game and nothing changes\"... the weight of a dark choice is huge. Nothing can be taken back, and it forever changes your playthrough. Reset the game, and the characters know. Events change. And with each curious kill, you, in turn, turn from the only human in a land of monsters into the biggest monster in a land of innocents. In the end, ignoring what Undertale sets out to do, which is to let you experience childlike innocence and fun, only makes it delibrately change the game into a quieter, more grim story. Very little character development, and the world isn't explained to you, nothing. There's very little reward for going through this route. Yet it is a choice you can do. Granted, you get two of the hardest boss battles by becoming the murderer and will be forced into Game Overs repeatedly from them, but even that is a message from the game... It's trying to stop you from getting to the end of this route. Before its too late.  It's as if you're doing deeds in an actual living, breathing world. And that's what makes it even more terrifying when you decide to become a murderer instead of a savior, because only you know that you're willingly going forward to obliterate every weakling in front of you. It's a test of your willpower, and it's your choice. The worst thing? The damage cannot be repaired. Go clean, or go home tainted. The game even gives you the choice to completely delete everyone's happiness after the most satisfying happy ending. The happiness you worked so hard to earn. And you can even become the murderer after saving the world, which will only permanently taint your game and never let you have a satisfying ending again. That's absolutely brutal, and yet that's still a choice. Amazing.  Yes, this game might not be for everyone. The humour may become dry after a while for some people, and tons of gamers nowadays like to bash at popular games instead of trying it out, just because they feel accomplished by doing it. But, if like me, you are willing to experience why everyone's been talking about this game, give it a shot. Hell, even if you hate the game to bits and want to kill everyone, buy the game, do so, and at least have your own personal experience before refunding it. This game does the morality concept so well that other games can only dream of doing the same, and it is one not to be forgotten.  It is a sin to call Undertale a game. Doing that would categorize Undertale into the bland and consequence-free \"kill-em-all\" genres that a lot of games are falling into now.  Undertale is a story-driven, emotional experience.","hours":15.3,"funny_percent":0.06985294117647059,"helpful_percent":0.9171122994652406}

{"review":"(Mostly spoiler-free review) I hate turn-based RPGs. This is my Game of the Year. What.  After becoming ULTRA-JADED about gaming with the cancellation of Silent Hills, this game re-established that games can be really, really frickin good.  This thing was made with an incredible amount of love, and it shows in every nook and cranny, every joke, every secret conversation you never thought a game dev would have thought to include. Tobyfox is the most thorough dev ever. I'm continuously impressed with how many things he thought to include in this game, and how he managed to make it all extremely fun the entire way through. You'd think you've seen everything in this game, but you haven't. There's always another amazing thing, another way to turn the genre on its head, another great joke you didn't see coming. And it stays engaging the entire time, supported by a cast of fantastic, endearing, hilarious characters. Great puzzles too, imo!   It avoids all the things about (turn-based and non) RPGs that I despise:  -There's no grinding (unless you want to) -Battles are a great length and never overstayed their welcome for me -There's no boring menu-navigation-only-based combat (bullet dodging/timing-based stuff really spices it up, as well as bossfights always having a new, really fun gameplay twist on them!) -There's no unlikable/unrelatable characters that go on and on about you being the \"Chosen One\" or whatever -No plot where you gotta go to the 7 temples and find the 7 sacred whatevers and then oh wait now that you've gotten those 7 sacred whatevers, you gotta go to 4 extra places and get 4 SUPER sacred whatevers...  -No backtracking (unless you want to! Backtracking is actually usually rewarded with more fun conversations and such.) -No constant equipping and unequipping items because, oh, this one is +2 Def but -3 Speed but THIS one is +3 Speed and -2 Def but THIS one is immune to fire and this one is... -It actually has a way more complex, useful moral than \"Evil is Bad, Good is Good.\" Everyone has relateable motivations. -The writing doesn't suck like 90% of RPGs. It has a wonderful sense of humor and a simple plot that is underlaid with complex emotions. -Has jokes about anime, doesn't take itself seriously.  I could gush about it forever. Undertale's not only made me less jaded about gaming, but also less jaded about real life. It has a strong message about empathy that stays everpresent, while somehow not being cloying about it, or shoving the message down your throat. It's simply a wonderful experience, please play this thing!!","hours":13.4,"funny_percent":0.10057471264367816,"helpful_percent":0.8885057471264368}
{"review":"When this little game rolled onto the Steam storefront on September 15th of 2015, I think it’s pretty safe to say hardly anyone probably could’ve imagined the impact it would have. I know I certainly didn’t; after all, my first exposure to Undertale came in the form of seeing the backlash its own fanbase brought upon it, alongside the vocal cynics and critics who panned it as “overrated garbage”. With claims flying left and right that it was the next Five Nights At Freddy’s and constant jokes about how it was “Tumblr’s favorite game”, I had plenty of reason to be skeptical.  When I looked into things myself, though, I found something far different than what I had been anticipating. Even from the very first moments I saw it in action, Undertale…connected with me, in a way few games have ever managed to, first impression or otherwise. As time continued on, I was shocked to see just how much love the game was receiving, including praise from such people as Totalbiscuit and Yahtzee (people known to have trouble enjoying most JRPGs), and so it rapidly became clear that there had to be something to this game; something big. If it could so thoroughly draw in even those who typically can’t enjoy the genre, then if nothing else, it had to be worth checking out.  I went in with some damn high expectations. What I got was one of the best games I’ve ever played.  I truly wish I had the words to properly explain what Undertale is to me. I could go on for hours about the near-perfection of the soundtrack. I could rave about the writing and how rewardingly rich in detail and nuance it is. I could praise it for its characters and the level of care put into making even the most minor NPCs come to life with personality. I could write a freakin dissertation on the sheer brilliance of how it uses meta not only to comment on the tropes and conventions of its genre, but also as a powerful gameplay and storytelling tool that rewards replay value. I could gush until the end of time about the powerful messages Undertale presents and the skill with which it presents them, even addressing real world issues with an inspiring amount of dignity.   However, what I truly adore the most about this game is how unapologetic it is. It’s never afraid to be what it is, and that confidence takes its strengths and makes them into something far greater than the sum of those parts. From start to finish, Undertale is one of the most utterly brilliant games I’ve ever seen, executed with a pitch-perfect prowess that creates an experience the likes of which few other games can match.   There is always something new; another layer to be peeled back; another beautiful detail to be discovered. And the deeper one digs, the more brilliantly this absolute diamond of a gem sparkles. No part of Undertale is manufactured: not a single pixel has escaped the loving caress of a gentle crafting hand, and as the offspring of a mere $51,000 Kickstart (over 10x the amount Toby asked for), it’s easily one of the most refreshing games of the last few years. Undertale made me laugh. Undertale made me cry. Undertale made me think deeply about the world around me.  But most powerfully of all, Undertale touched me unlike any game before it. It's no small wonder, then, that upon completion it became my favorite game that I've ever played.  Yes indeed, this wonderfully unforgettable experience.  It fills me. With determination.  I adore this game.  ----- EDIT: Now my nomination for The “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award.","hours":59.9,"funny_percent":0.03763440860215054,"helpful_percent":0.9247311827956989}

I am not the kind of person to normally go in for conceptual hipster nonsense, and I say that because that's what I thought this game was.

{"review":"a lot of negative reviews claim this game's community is \"awful\", \"cancerous\" and \"perverted\".  they might be right  however, it looks like those people did not get the ♥♥♥♥ing memo that this place is for reviewing the game, and not the fanbase. why is fanbase even important in the first place? you can simply ignore it, if worst comes to worst.  so what about the game?  really, there are only two issues i have with undertale. once you begin the game, the first couple hours are absolutely boring as all hell. i have a feeling this might just be me though, because no one else seems to have similar gripes.  the second, more pertinent issue, is that the game lacks length. if you can read, you can see that i've played undertale for about 30 hours, and that's about as long as it's probably going to last you if you progress at a decent pace. keep in mind that i've very literally done everything there is to do and seen everything there is to see in these 30 hours.  now that that's out of the way, please consider the following:  the game has a really good story. i'm not gonna lie, one of the game's 3 endings almost made me cry. i'm not an emotional person either. i've played through games with truly gripping, touching stories like spec ops: the line and felt next to nothing, but undertale absolutely knocks the competition out of the park.   when i saw the credits roll for the last time, and knew that my time with undertale was done, i got the same feeling i've only felt before after finishing a very good book. i was sad because it was done, and sad because it would be a long time before anything would ever come close to the experience i'd had.   ok, well now you know how undertale affected me. let me explain why this happened.  1. undertale has wonderful music: toby fox, the game's maker, is actually not a writer nor programmer, but a \"music producer\". this complements perfectly the excellent battle system, which i'm about to discuss  2. battles. some of the game's battles, especially battles where you really are the bad guy (if you play the game you'll se what i mean), are exceptional. the epic momentum of toby fox's well written score works perfectly with the fun and fluid combat.  3. writing. toby fox seems to have a rare talent for excellent dramatic/comedic timing. if you play the game, as you should, you will see exactly what i mean. furthermore, the characters and story are just really fleshed out. in fact, i'm astounded to see someone from a music background succeed with flying colours where professional writers have failed many times over.   i highly encourage you to try this game","hours":30.6,"funny_percent":0.01834862385321101,"helpful_percent":0.9388379204892966}

{"review":"Wow.  Just, wow.  I'm at a loss of words. This game...  ...It's an absolute MASTERPIECE.  For my loyal readers, do you remember my Shovel Knight craze last year?  Undertale is my Shovel Knight of 2015.   Graphics  The graphics are a simple 8-bit style, and although it's considered \"generic\" because of the whole \"8 bit indie game made by one guy\" sort of thing, this game uses it properly. I know, that seems really weird, but it's true. If you play the game and take a certain route, the final boss WILL blow your mind with the visuals. Not much here to say, it's not what's supposed to make this game so noteworthy, but it's still acceptable nonetheless.  Gameplay  Undertale is a lot like Earthbound in many ways, the most notable trait being the turn based combat and how it's portrayed. Nowadays, LOTS of games have opportunities where you can spare or kill a certain character and decide their fate. Their flaw, however, is that the said death often is just shrugged off, both in the game's world AND in real life. Undertale takes this concept and cranks it up a notch, leaving literally every single character's fate in your hands. You can go for a pacifist run and kill no one, and this is the one I would highly recommend going for if you do decide to purchase this masterpiece. There's also the neutral ending, which is the most common of the bunch but has one of the most creative final bosses I've ever seen in video games. I won't spoil much, but it will BLOW your mind, you can trust me on that. There's also the genocide run, which is incredibly difficult to pull off because of how emotionally difficult it is to actually kill this lovable cast of monsters. The combat itself is like Earthbound's, as said earlier. This being said, Undertale takes yet another step forward, adding bullet hell and platforming to the mix and blends the two perfectly, making the game far more exciting, while keeping the original RPG elements.   Story  This is the very core of why Undertale is such an unforgettable experience. Of course, though, you shouldn't be shocked at this point, because most of the internet will agree with me on that. The cast of characters is so diverse and unique, each one having traits to make them likable or the one you'd love to kill on a genocide run. For example, you have Sans, my favorite of the bunch. He's a laid back, prankster, and easy going skeleton who has a brother named Papyrus. What Papyrus lacks in intelligence, he makes up for with a big heart for humans. You also have Flowey, who immediately will creep you out because of how ruthless he is. As for the plot itself, it's one big emotional rollercoaster you would want to ride over and over and over again. It has its hilarious moments, since the writing is surprisingly well done, while it has its sad moments, too. What takes the cake on all of this, though, is that it literally makes you rethink everything you knew about video games. The fourth wall is also broken often, and this is done in the most clever and creative ways. It's like Kid Icarus: Uprising, except Undertale does it far better. I almost forgot, too, but every action in this game will be remembered by the characters, long after you actually beat it. People have called this game a \"sentient being\" and I can actually agree with them on that. Trust me, Undertale is literally perfect for storytelling, and I won't be shocked if you cried a bit. It's hard not to, and with such a unique cast of lovable characters, it further justifies my point.  Audio  I have a friend who also loves Undertale, and the one thing he seems to point out about it is the soundtrack. I can't blame him, because it's really catchy. Remember how I said this game was my Shovel Knight of 2015? I wasn't kidding about that, it has the awesome soundtrack to go with it. You have Bonetrousle, the sinister, yet lighthearted and catchy tune that fits Papyrus. There's the Spider Dance, Muffet's theme. This theme is a lot more evil but far more catchy, and is one of my personal favorites. The king of the bunch, however, is one that didn't directly originate from Undertale: Megalovania. Sans' theme is slowly becoming an iconic boss theme, as it has been used in two different times in the past, and this variation is definitely my favorite of the three. You also have some humorous songs, namely the Dogsong. I won't get too in-depth with that one, but I need to say this now: GEEEET DUNKED ON! There is no voice acting, but why does that even matter? This game doesn't need it. Overall, this game has some high quality music, and I love it that way.  Replayability  As I said earlier, this game has multiple endings. Want to know what makes it interesting, though? The characters will remember EVERYTHING you've done. I mean that, too. Mess with the game's files and try to beat it that way, I dare you. With the multiple endings, the replayability is far more dependent on you. If you have no soul, you'll probably try and do a genocide run while doing the other two runs as well. Maybe you'll try and do a pacifist one so you don't have to go through the pain of killing anyone, then do a neutral, and finish with a genocide ending. Just remember, EVERY choice will be remembered permanently.  Verdict  Undertale is easily my GotY at this point in time, but it's also one of the most creative games I've ever seen. This is an absolute masterpiece, and I really hope it wins a LOT of awards. Do I recommend this game? Well, I'll join the internet on this one and say, \"Of course!\" Just be ready to stock up on spaghetti, because you'll need it while you stress-eat and do a playthrough of this gem.

{"review":"♥♥♥♥. This is a tough one to write, not at all like my usual reviews. I'm just sort of rambling and gushing because there's so much to say about Undertale... and I can't SAY anything without spoiling the experience for you!  Yes, you!  Buy this game, don't watch anything on YouTube about it, don't read the Undertale subreddit or any wikis, don't even read this review (though I've avoided spoilers, of course) – just seal yourself into a room with a computer and some kind of makeshift toilet, play it to completion, clean yourself for the love of God, and come back.  ...  Hero? Villain? Or something wholly other?  The year isn't out and there are some huge releases yet to come, but that being said...  Undertale is a GOTY contender, indie or otherwise.   It's the best RPG in a year of amazing RPG releases.   It's the funniest, most well-written game in, well, a very long time.   It's the most genuinely heartwarming (and incredibly dark) game in, well, a very long time.   It's challenging but surmountable, given a little skill and a whole lot of determination.   And it's also the most mind-♥♥♥♥y game in, well, a very long time, in an entirely unique way! Sure, you can compare it to Metal Gear's Psycho Mantis or Eternal Darkness' sanity meter effects, though that won't do Undertale's special, thoughtful mechanics justice.   But I digress.  You play as a tiny, gender-neutral child with bad fashion sense who falls down a mountain into a cavernous underworld filled with all sorts of fantastical monsters – all of whom have been banished there after losing a war with humankind. Now you have to get yourself back to the sunny, human-friendly overworld.   Fairly standard so far, complete with the pretty concept art cutscenes and humdrum hero origin tale.  Then five minutes pass and all your expectations just sort of fly out the proverbial window screaming, never to return.  Like, ever.  Thus begins your six, seven, or eight hour (initial) journey into Undertale. You'll encounter all sorts of wacky, zany characters and monsters, puzzles, traditional RPG-type environments... loaded with obstacles standing between you and the finish line. And it's up to you decide how you're going to approach the aforementioned zany characters and monsters. Sure, you can do the traditional “kill indiscriminately” thing, but that's just one solution. See, Undertale is an RPG where you can beat the whole damn thing without killing anyone!  Like, you can hug your way through the entire affair!  Easy enough, right?  And you can always just reload a save if you screw up, right?  …  Anyhoo, combat mechanics are... it's hard to describe. It's like a traditional turn-based RPG combat system only, well, those expectations all went screaming out that window I mentioned earlier. Your heart appears in a window below the enemy you're currently dealing with and you have to dodge bullet-hell-style attacks... most of the time anyway. Even after your old expectations are but a distant memory, newly established expectations go flying out screaming too.  It's a little weird.  If fighting is your style you'll have that option, of course. Presented with a flashing bar, hit the sweet spot and you'll do the most possible damage; rinse and repeat. You can access items, check on the enemy's stats and what have you, pursue a peaceful resolution... lots of options, and every monster is a little different.  Well, not a little different – incredibly different, incredible variety! And figuring out their ticks, traits, fears, and dreams is all part of the fun puzzle that is Undertale.   But there's more!  Undertale's music is fabulous – in that wonderfully synthetic, retro way. Every character has a “voice,” every monster, region, and special event has a theme, and when appropriate, the music is chillingly absent. It's the best part of this game - beside the top-notch writing.  I said every character has a “voice,” referring to the musical tones playing during dialogue. But they also each have their own VOICE, you understand? There's the overly protective mother, the bad jokester, the lacking-any-self-awareness fella... but even then it's just scratching the surface. These ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s emote! These sprites have some Shakespearean depth that becomes more apparent with each hour, each playthrough.   You'll care for them, whether you want to or not.  …   What else is there to say? I laughed out loud two dozen times or so, I lost count; I nearly cried at least five times, I was God damned jumpscared more than once, I had an existential crisis, and I'd do it all over again.   And again.  And again.   There's, like, nothing I can even complain about! Were some of the fights tedious, long-winded? Yeah, but I might be biased because I wanted to just enjoy more dialogue, more strange interactions, more environments. Were some of the references lost on me (particularly Anime stuff)? Sure, but that's what Google is for.   Undertale just is... objectively good.  Objectively great.  It's an experience like Shadow of the Colossus, Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Half-Life, Red Dead Redemption, Dark Souls, EarthBound... a little, unassuming 2D RPG game released in 2015 stands shoulder to shoulder with some of the best games of all time – one I initially judged by its cover and ignored.   I'm glad I deleted that particular corrupted save file and started fresh, because missing out on this game would have left a little heart-shaped void that I might have never filled.","hours":16,"funny_percent":0.19338422391857507,"helpful_percent":0.8651399491094147}

{"review":"There has been no game that has affected me as deeply as Undertale has.  This is coming from someone, who did not understand what the word 'empathy' meant, until age 11, and is still very much trying hard to be a decent human being; the distinction here is important: Empathy, and caring for people does not come naturally for me.  Yet here's a game that made me care. A person that takes the most pragmatic route in every game. A person who was banned from multiple games for griefing, and toxic behavior. I ended up caring deeply about ALL of the characters in this game, and I simply could not bring myself to lay a finger on most of them. I was filled with DETERMINATION to go against how I usually play, and make damn sure that nobody gets hurt, and everyone gets their happy ending.  Toby, man, I have no idea how you managed to do this, but.. Thank you.  As for you, dear reader, you're probably asking; is it worth the asking price?  You tell me. Buy it. Play it for two hours.

{"review":"I thought my favorite game this year would be The Witcher 3, maybe MGSV. I put 70 hours into the former and 50 hours into the latter. Yet I feel like the 8 hours I spent getting the true pacifist ending of this game was the most emotionally invested I have ever been in a video game. It has a beautiful soundtrack that I haven't stopped listening to since I beat the game, unique gameplay that I haven't seen in any other game, quirky humor reminiscent of Earthbound/LISA, and a story and characters that I don't think I'll forget any time soon.

{"review":"Ah yes, this game. The one with the Steam page you click on several times wondering if you should buy it or not, the game itself bringing you in, the community drawing you away, paranoid you might become one of them.  You're not alone, oh no, far from it. I felt the same way at one point. Then I decided, \"screw it, I'm buying the game\". So I did. I have owned this game for a couple weeks now. To date, I have not drawn any fanart or written any fanfiction about it. Hell, I don't even have a DeviantArt account. But the community aside, let's look at the game itself.  Undertale is quite good, yet doesn't deserve all the hype it got. It's a nice, tasteful indie game, with quite a bit of silliness and humour added. Some being childish (groan), some being fanbase exclusive (sarcastic \"oh boy\"), but most of it being something you can at least get a little chuckle out of.  The music is really good. It uses a mixture of 8-bit and orchestral instruments meshed together oh so perfectly. This game would definitely be nothing without it.  The \"story-rich\" story isn't very rich at all. It's still good though. To sum it up without spoilers, it's about a kid who went exploring on their own to a mountain everyone knows is inhabited by monsters. Thus begins your journey through a strange new world, wondering if you'll ever go back.  The graphics? Bootleg-grade. Solid colours and poorly drawn sprites (except for the characters) everywhere. But don't let that stop you from buying this game. Seriously, why does such a little thing as graphics matter when you've got a nice story, nice tunes, and nice characters?  Overall, I give this game a... ??/10  \"What? An unknown rating? Why?\" Because I know a lot of you will think differently than I will about this game and that's okay. I know that opinions on this will differ from person to person. Truth of the matter is, if you don't mind a short, silly, yet still tasteful game that may not always make sense, then this game is for you. If you want a game that isn't as silly and makes more sense, I'd suggest leaving this game out of your library.  Honestly, I cannot decide how this game should be rated. There's a variety of positives, yet a variety of negatives as well. I'm recommending it though because it's definitely not garbage, that's for sure.  In conclusion, you did good, Mr. Fox, and I'm sorry this game got way more popular than you wanted it to be. Have a cookie. You deserve it.","hours":45.3,"funny_percent":0.09188544152744631,"helpful_percent":0.8400954653937948}
{"review":"I love this game so much, I made the trailer for it! I did so after being super impressed by the demo, and asking Toby if there was some way I could help out.   After experiencing the final game, my high expectations were absolutely blown away.  Undertale is a fantastic, novel, unforgettable RPG experience in so many ways.   It couples thoughtful, reactive NPC interactions with a very engaging bullet hell / varied minigame combat system that, unlike most rpgs, never becomes a bore or a slog. Difficulty was a gentle ramp, though affords opportunties for the player to really challenge themselves. All of the combat defenses are unique to each enemy, serving as both funny and clever expressions of their personalities. Mechanically the combat is so solid it makes me wonder why I haven't seen it done before.   Undertale ties its combat and the rest of its game systems so intricately into its narrative, into achieving what it sets out to do as an experience, that it's almost magical.  The characters are genuinely likable and relatable. I find this supremely important to stay interested in narrative-focused games and Undertale does not disappoint. Depending on your interactions with characters, the choices you make will hit you. Hard.  Audio... Well, Toby Fox is known for doing some tremendous music tracks. On first listen to many of Undertale's songs I said to myself 'oh yeah, I can tell this is going to become an instant classic.' The melodies and compositions are just excellent, and truly help create memorable in-game experiences. You want the soundtrack, trust me.  I might consider graphics to be the 'weakest' aspect of Undertale, but I'd stress that they are utterly appropriate and support the experience. Really the one nitpick I have is that I'd liked to have seen more NPC animations in the overworld, to make monsters feel as lively and ~sassy~ as they do in combat. But it's a small quibble in a very, very intricate game. Ultimately Undertale's simple, cartoony, certainly Mother-esque graphic style suits it perfectly, enhancing and fortifying a very chill, friendly tone.  A single playthrough is in the neighborhood of six hours, but by design Undertale encourages both replay and reeximation of choices made throughout the game. I went through its content repeatedly, eagerly looking for new insights and interactions I had missed, and I feel like I got way more value than I could ever hope to expect for the price.  Get this game, it's touching. It's worthwhile. It's Undertale.   Oh, and Toby? Thanks for letting me help you. It means a lot to me.","hours":27.4,"funny_percent":0.04076086956521739,"helpful_percent":0.8777173913043478}

{"review":"At first when I saw this game I didn't think much of it. All I knew about the game was that there were two cool looking skeletons named Sans and Papyrus. Other than that I thought nothing else of this game. Infact I thought this game was lame in all honesty. So, one day I decided to purchase the game. I thought it was going to be a waste of money. Little did I know this game was going to be the most heart wrenching, intense, emotional game I will ever play in my life. The characters in this game are memberable and relatable. Theres always excitment everywhere you turn. I've been so attached to the characters in this game. When they gave me the option to kill I could never bring myself to it. Even after beating this game I can't bring myself to hurting the characters. WHICH IS SO STRANGE BECAUSE THEY ARE VIDEO GAME CHARACTERS. This just goes to show that this game will make you attach yourself to the characters you interact with. And the underlying theme of this game is incredibly strong. I don't want to reveal it in this review you're just going to have to beat the game and find out for yourself. This game is incredibly powerful and it's totally worth the price. You will be entertained for hours and your heart will be torn into bits and pieces (trust me, my heart was crying so much) If you are still reading this I thank you for your time. Toby Fox and his team did an amazing job on this video game. I've never been happier with a game such as this one.

{"review":"Undertale, “the friendly RPG where no one has to die.” When a game makes you feel bad for killing monsters and makes you consider not killing any more, then it definitely does something right!  Story  The story goes that both monsters and human once ruled over earth, living together, until war broke out between the two races. The humans defeated the monsters and drove them to the depths of Mt. Ebott, trapped with a magic spell. You appear on a bed of golden flowers, and are greeted by a flower, and taught about friendliness pellets. Afterwards, you can choose to massacre every monster you meet, or choose to show mercy to your opponents. Your actions of killing or mercy will shape the way the game progresses, as well as how others view you. The dialogues, and even the music of the game will become happier or distorted based on your killings or acts of mercy. With that said, there are a few endings that can be achieved within the game, some being more satisfying than others; some feeling like you are cutting onions, and some just for the cold hearted. What makes these outcomes to impactful, and sometimes sad, is the way the monsters react to the player’s actions, and sometimes questioning your actions and making you feel like a monster for the things you do. This is also true when you do immoral things like take more than one candy from a bowl of candy that says “take one please”.  Gameplay  Gameplay is very easy to catch on to, and is like one of those old time rpg games like Earthbound. Your goal is simple, but complex, just get through the game(through any means necessary). Your initial goal, or why you are there are not stated, but you can assume you fell down the mountain (as seen in the opening). Your real goal is to play the game as you like, exploring this unique world of monsters and see what it has to offer. While you explore the world, you will have numerous random encounters with monsters, in which you are a heart that must avoid monster’s attacks, and will die if you take too much damage (causing you to restart at your last save). Pretty easy to understand and play, but a bit difficult to master, as some of the later encounters will be a lot more difficult to dodge seamlessly, and may prove to require a bit more thought and endurance to overcome, rather than just one lucky turn. The game itself is not too difficult, in that it does not have any difficult puzzles to do, and no grinding is required to win the game, as the game can be beaten without killing a single thing.  Visuals/Audio  The visuals are all a bit old timey, but that does not take away from the experience. As for the audio, there are a wide variety of songs that make the game very fun while in combat scenarios. The beginning music was a bit new to me, as I did not think it would have the old retro type of music, but it surprisingly worked well and was not monotonous, and seemed to match the backdrops, and battles very well.  Characters  Why would I include a characters section in a review? The answer is, because they are such an integral part of the game, otherwise it would be like any other rpg, with the exception of the option to spare your opponents. The characters are what make this game so memorable. It’s not the fact these characters are super likeable, since you may end up disliking or even hating some of them, but the fact these characters will end up growing on you in the end. Without such a unique and hilarious cast of characters, the player would not feel any real motivation to spare them, or any remorse if the player decides to kill any of them. They are in all respects to this game, the driving force that makes it so popular and why it causes many (if not all) it’s players to shed tears.  Verdict: 9/10  Staying determined really is the only way to beat this game!

{"review":"Product received for free  Before I get into the game, I'll start off by saying that my friends played it almost as soon as it came out. One of them maybe even helped Kickstart it, I don't know for sure. I thought they were cringy as hell. They bought it for me, but I refused to play it for like a year and a half or something like that. I thought it was gonna be so overrated and that it was going to bore me to sleep. Hell, I really only played it because I wanted some of the trading cards that would come with it so I could get CS:GO cases. I honestly thought I'd just play it and be done.  But,  I have never been more wrong in my entire life  This game literally changed my outlook on life in general. The story is amazing, so long as you keep an open mind. The soundtrack was phenomenal. The songs perfectly portrayed what was going on in the story, especially when big story events happened. My only recommendation for playing this game would be to spare every monster before you try any of the other ways to play. If you're anything like me, it will change you. Over all, Undertale has become one of my favorite story-driven games ever. I haven't felt this attached to a fictional story in years. Undertale's fanbase is cringy. Hell, you probably think I'm cringy just by reading this. However, if you are in any way curious about this game, just try it.
