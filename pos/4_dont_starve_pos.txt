{"review":"One of my absolute favorite games. It's quite a challenging game, especially until you get the hang of things. It's a dark, twisted survival game where pretty much everything is trying to kill you. You've got to scavenge, build things, and defend yourself, all while trying to pay attention to the environment (weather) and the fullness of your stomach. The developers also seem to be constantly updating the game and adding huge amounts of awesome content for free. It just keeps expanding and you just keep wanting to play again and again. Highly recommended!  October 2014 Edit: Multiplayer is coming to Don't Starve!

{"review":"Do I recommend this game? Hell yes. Every single time you start a new game file, it's an entirely random generated world where nothing is the same as the last. You can play this game for weeks and still not discover all its secrets. It's a sandbox strategy game that keeps you on your toes for anything and everything that's trying to kill you. And believe me, there's a hundred and one monsters who all want your face on a platter.   GAME TIPS:  1. Always have a means to make fire. Always. 2. Pigs are your friends. Build your base near them. 3. Spiders are not. 4. BEWARE THE BEES.  5. Beefalo herds are awesome. Fill your pockets with their endless poo. Great fire fuel. 6. Prepare for periodic hound attacks. Make spears and tooth traps. 7. Pick flowers.  8. Not starving is the LEAST of your worries.","hours":172.7,"funny_percent":0.3275862068965517,"helpful_percent":0.9672413793103448}
{"review":"Don't Starve is one of the games I will never forget!I'm sure you ask yourself why? Let me explain: When I saw the game I were like ,,Naahhhh I'm not going to buy this.'' but a few days later I looked a second time and tought ,,Why not?It looks funny. And it says you can celebrate with your piggy friends.'' that was when I bought it. I can tell you I got addicted to the game. The first day I played 12 h's. I told my brother and my friend they should buy it. They did it and got addicted, too. I think nearly every Computer can run the graphics and the the characters are funny, too. With every game I started a new story war born. For example I started my first game and forgot to make a fire when the night came up I died and I was like ,,Why?I should have know''. And I learned with every new day that the game hates me. The game likes to punch you in the face. And the community is amazing. In the forums you can see artist, storywriters, survivers and so on. Pretty fast updates with new content to explore and even merchandise. It's a tip for everyone who like survival games. You will love it.

{"review":"This survival rougelike is excellent. You are trapped in a cruel, randomly-generated world where everything wants to kill you, and left to fend for yourself in the wilderness. You will start off with nothing, collecting supplies to make a fire and survive your first night. The goal is simple -- survive for as long as possible.  The randomness of the world generation keeps it fresh for every playthrough. There are countless ways to die, ranging from freezing to death to getting mauled by a tentacle. Once you die, you will be forced to start anew, which can be frustrating.  I seriously love this game, and it really is worth picking up. You should also pick up the DLC which adds a lot more challenge to the game. This game is EXTREMELY addicting.","hours":71.3,"funny_percent":0.014970059880239521,"helpful_percent":0.9431137724550899}

{"review":"This game is fantastic.  It combines roguelike and survival gameplay, dumping you in a strange territory to explore, forage, learn, craft and progress on your own terms. For the most part, the controls and interface are intuitive, so it's simply a matter of deciding where to go or what to do.  The game is called Don't Starve, and hunger is indeed a major theme. If you go a few days without food, you will die. That said, there are plenty of other things to kill you - a variety of animals and monsters, environmental hazards, and your own dwindling sanity. To battle this, you rely on building your own equipment, consumables and structures, ranging from weapons and armor to crock pots to unwholesome magical devices.  Don't Starve can be brutal, so you should expect to die, but just making good progress is rewarding in itself. You unlock new characters as you play, each with little touches or specialties to diversify your experience. And while there are some pretty powerful or useful items you can make, there are still a lot of ways to play, and they're all valid (which is good, because sometimes you don't have much choice.)  If you're bored or frustrated, you can change your experience by starting a new game and adding or removing features. If you're tired of fighting certain monsters, you can just turn them off. I haven't messed with this myself, as I like the feeling of surprise, and playing the game as-is, but the developers have left the doors wide open for custom play experiences. In the same way, you can make use of a wealth of user-created elements.  There are a few things I missed for awhile, like the fact that you can view a map of everywhere you've been so far, but overall the game doesn't suffer much from lack of tutorial or hand-holding. You can go read everything on a wiki if you prefer, but this is a game where I don't actually begrudge trial and error learning. Encountering strange new things and deciding what to do with them is a ton of fun, even if it sometimes gets you killed.  A warning (at least from my perspective) - this game is so immersive, I prefer to keep playing it for hours on end once I start. It's not a game I enjoy having to stop, unless I come to good stopping point like dying at the end of a long survival run. In fact, sometimes I forget to eat for a long time when I play this.

{"review":"Boy Scouts should be required to play Don't Starve before going on any camping trips – they could even get a badge for it, in the form of a gaping, pointy-toothed wormhole. Or maybe a friendly campfire.Don't Starve is, at its most basic level, a survival game. It features crafting, mysticism, science and all manner of nasty creatures, especially once it gets dark. In order to stay alive, players have to use the surrounding flora and fauna to craft increasingly complex tools, starting with a simple axe and building up to items as intricate as lightning rods and carpeted flooring.When you die in Don't Starve, your current world is destroyed, along with the things you created while surviving in it. There are advanced tricks to escape death – constructing a Meat Effigy or finding an Amulet – but rest assured that you will most likely die before gaining the experience required to craft or dig up these items. A Touch Stone will also resurrect fallen players, but finding that structure early on is more luck than certain death. I did find it, at the beginning of my second run, but I didn't know what the strange circle surrounded by pig heads was, so I didn't use it, and when I died, I was dead.That said, curiosity and a desire to poke at unfamiliar things are essential in Don't Starve.Dying is a fundamental gameplay aspect. Death won't always come from starvation; it inhabits many forms, including beasts large and small, and the terrors that hide in the night. A clock-like status bar in the upper right corner of the map shows how many days you've survived and the current time, and it provides health, hunger and mental gauges. It's an efficient system, the clock hand moving from yellow to red to blue – day, afternoon and night – and circles of health systems draining without proper care. One glance and it's instantly clear how long until you have to build a fire, or if you need to eat or rest.On top of a solid survival game, Don't Starve is a deep, layered experiment in crafting and exploration. Throughout the biomes are wormholes that transport players to different lands, which offer new materials for building science machines – which unlock new crafting recipes – and heartier structures. New characters are unlocked with experience – 20 points per day survived. This is all in Sandbox Mode, but Don't Starve also features an Adventure Mode, which players can enter by finding and activating Maxwell's Door. Adventure Mode is Don't Starve's campaign, pitting Wilson against Maxwell, the demonic genius who brought Wilson to the wilderness in the first place. It's five grueling chapters – upon first entrance, players lose all items and crafting recipes, and can only carry four items between Adventure Mode chapters. Die in Adventure Mode and you're spat back out into Sandbox Mode, precisely where you left it.For its art style, deceptively dark vibe and experimental approach, Don’t Starve is certainly worth a look.","hours":27.8,"funny_percent":0.19327731092436976,"helpful_percent":0.9159663865546218}
{"review":"Don’t Starve tries its best to be a haunting challenge, with a Tim Burton art style. It does a good job.     The core gameplay is simply trying to survive. gathering materials and food during the day, and huddling by a fire, trying to craft useful tools at night. As the day to night cycle progresses, so does the seasonal cycle. After a couple days, winter comes, making it harder to collect food, and hunt. The nights become longer and the days become shorter as you huddle by your fire, trying not to freeze to death. During winter, your homemade farms stop becoming useful. Huntable animals disappear and other more dangerous animals come in swarms.     As far as the story goes, there is an oddly rich story, which can only be experienced by skilled players. Whenever a new game is started, Maxwell, the games antagonist, warns him to get food. The real story mode cannot be achieved unless the player has found the four pieces, and then moves to the next level. After beating a few levels, they reach the epilogue, where maxwell is unlocked as a playable character and the game is complete.     Don't starve’s graphics and art style is very Tim Burton. The monsters, alone have a scary but yet cute feel to them. The sound of the game is very creepy yet welcoming. depending on what the player is doing at the time. The music changes whenever the player is in combat or not, making the combat feel even more immersive.     Don’t stare also has a large amount of options. Not only can you pick your character but you can also modify the world and its many resources. Players can make the world a food rich wonderland, or a barren wasteland, randomized each time. Each playable character has its own stats, and buffs/debuffs, tailoring to each possible playstyle.      The in game crafting provides a large variety of machines, tools, farms and structures. The player can craft anything from carpets, campfires, spears, drying racks, walls, bee-based mines and a large variety of clothing, all with special perks. Winter coats to keep you warm, mining hats to provide light, feather hats to increase how many birds there are, armour to reduce damage, and a flower garland to keep sanity up.       Don't starve does lots of things right.    The art style and sound design is amazing for this game  The crafting feels organic and worth the effort.  The clothes in the game change not only how the player looks, but also has bonuses.   The Monsters in the game are interesting and fun to hunt.  The many varieties of food make the game more interesting  The story is enjoyable, even if you don't play through it.   The antagonist is one of the best “bad guys” i've seen in games for a while  The different playable characters are fantastic   The game has a customizable world setting.  The game has playing cards   Don't starve does a few thing wrong.   The cave mechanic is hardly explored until late game  The game has a few bugs still needing to be fixed  The follower mechanic should be touched up  The vanilla game can be a tad boring  The player may rage-quit after dieing on a long time world.  The game lacks achievements  The game lacks vanilla co-op   Don’t Starve isn't only a magnificent survival game, but it is also a well told story, for those who care to play it. I believe that there is a large market for this game, and that market keeps on growing. If you don't already own this game, pick it up on sale. Its on sale almost every winter and summer sale. I payed full price for it and i think its worth it. ","hours":83.3,"funny_percent":0.09883720930232558,"helpful_percent":0.9534883720930233}

{"review":"Updated now to include the massive lot of new content and Klei's commitment to the game -  So. Tim Burton designs minecraft, this is what it would look like. That's the quick version. The not so quick version involves you attempting to survive in a world which is pretty much entirely out to kill you (even the trees will try to kill you...), having been dumped there by a mysterious character called Maxwell. It is down to you to, as with many Minecraft games, start from the ground up by collecting flint and twigs, and putting together rudimentary tools, before hacking down trees and mining rocks for the more advanced stuff. As your toolset grows, so do your options, and thankfully, so does your diet choices (berries work for a while, but there's nothing like cooked rabbit).  The game now has a fair bit of lore and background to it, and with the addition of caves, and sub areas, now has a more \"exploratory\" feel on top. Combined with the Steam Workshop, a slew of unlockable characters, and a soundtrack which I seriously suggest everyone who picks up the game -also- collects, results in an outstanding offering that will appeal to survivalists and minecrafters alike.","hours":21.4,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.8411910669975186}

{"review":"It’s a pity that Tim Burton hasn’t been involved in video games: both his visual style and his storytelling abilities would be welcome additions to our industry. Thankfully, niche approaches to style can find a welcome home in today’s indie market, and the folks down at Klei entertainment have turned that particular style onto the video game scene in their new 2-D open world survival title Don’t Starve. It’s a refreshing and unique entry into the genre, one that puts extra emphasis on the ‘surviving’, and that’s sure to give players a welcome challenge.  The goal in Don’t Starve is simple and straightforward (hint: read the title). The player takes control of a forlorn, classically British-looking protagonist, and although there is only one default starter character, other playable characters with potentially useful abilities unlock as the game progresses. When you start in the world, you’ve got only your bare hands to work with. There’s no tree-punching, thank goodness, but you’ll need to start off by hunting down some flint and sticks so you can fashion yourself an axe. Your first priorities are simply to acquire fire (which you must have to survive a night) and food (which, as it turns out, delays starvation). As luck would have it, it’s not enough to simply peg down a steady source of calories; if you’re not careful, you can also be killed in the conventional manner, in other words, by being ravenously eaten, poisoned, or pecked to death by some of Mother Nature’s wonders. There are also some native inhabitants, better armed and armored than you, who are probably best avoided. As if that weren’t enough, there’s one more danger that feels just a tad artificial: your character starts to go insane without having new things to think about (aka, crafting new items or gathering pleasant items). This provides an impetus to keep you gathering harder-to-find materials, and although this seems like a bit of a poor man’s way of encouraging you to explore and ‘techify’, the crafting is fun enough that it stands on its own two feet. Generally you’ll be quite happy to spend time gathering special items just because you want to, say, build yourself a suit of armor, or a new kind of animal trap. There are even cute hats to make that have the added bonus of keeping your sanity up.  If all of this sounds like an open-world creativity journey, think again. Don’t Starve does give you several nice options for survival. For example, your food sources can come from scavenging, farming, hunting, or even cultivating your own bees. However, in the harsh climates that you’ll be fighting through, your options are usually so limited that you’ll need to focus all your efforts on whatever strategy is most likely to let you live another day. It’s not a game of fun and frolicking: you’ve got to fix your problems now, before they grow to big and doom you by your own stupidity.  That’s all well and good for the basic ‘survive-and-thrive’ aspect of Don’t Starve, but there’s also a form of campaign in the guise of the Adventure Mode. Here, the player is placed into specially created worlds with particularly difficult settings: it might be extra cold, or extra dark, or the food might be extra hard to come by. Surviving in each world long enough to collect pieces of a McGuffin allow the player to progress to the next challenge, slowly uncovering a thin story as the adventure continues. It’s not a strong enough narrative to be an independent draw for most players, but gives a nice added challenge to the standard gameplay.  From its title to its music, Don’t Starve does an excellent job of perfectly nailing a unique tone: it’s always a little dark, a little humorous, and a little self-conscious. The soundtrack is mostly made to mimic small-ensemble Victorian era motifs, the sort of thing that you would expect to hear in a haunted mansion movie. That said, it feels like there’s not enough of this high quality music to go around. The light-hearted morbidity of the game is even reflected in what characters you can play with: it’d be so easy to simply make the player a terribly frightened little girl or boy, crying for his or her mommy. Instead, the characters in the game gleefully watch trees burn and take pleasure in slaughtering whatever cute furry animals they can find. It’s a kill-or-be-killed world, and your character loves every minute of it. But the best part about the game is that the environment itself practically has a character. Nature isn’t just a harsh environment: it’s out to get you. Chop up too many trees, or wring the necks of too many fluffy bunnies, and you might find yourself facing some particularly vengeful avatars of the outdoors.  The worldbuilding in Don’t Starve is a special treat, and is quite possibly the most enjoyable aspect of the game. The scenery and enemies are given a dark, edgy sketch style that looks a bit like a flannelgraph or felt puppet show. Birds and critters all have their distinctive hoots and whistles, and even the trees quiver when they grow new leaves (which, appropriately, happens in a sudden ‘pop’). Genre-wise, Don’t Starve sits nicely in that sweet spot of gothic aesthetics, partway between simple turn-of-the-century technology and homespun magic.  Comparisons between Don’t Starve and Minecraft are inevitable, but unfair. Don’t Starve isn’t nearly as open-ended: it’s more focused on the challenge of survival, and there’s very little call for customization at all in the game. All recipes are technically given to you in advance, although you may need to traverse a tech tree in order to gain access to them. The crafting in Don’t Starve is also more focused on utility - generally speaking you’ll be so busy trying desperately to build the weapons or shelter that you require, you won’t ever find yourself making something just for the fun of it. Instead of offering limitless exploration, Don’t Starve offers a particular feeling; that of being in a creepy, kooky horror story.  With only a few biomes and enemy types currently implemented, the game as it is only carries a decent amount of material, and replay value is sadly limited. The sticking point here is that, like Minecraft, Don’t Starve promises continual updates (and cleverly posts the date of the next game addition on its main menu). This makes the purchase of Don’t Starve something of a gamble: maybe it will fill up to the brim with new content, maybe it won’t, and only time will tell.  More so than in other genres of games, world building in survival games is important, because the world is your enemy. Just like every good heroic RPG needs a delicious villain to focus your conflict against, a good survival game needs to give the environment itself a personality. While most outdoor survival games do this by making the environment be something like an inviting, friendly host, Don’t Starve goes in the opposite direction by making the Mother Nature seem more like that weird cat lady who lives in the boarded-up house. It’s not so much an invitation to explore and enjoy yourself as it is a long list of dangers to avoid. Don’t pick fights with the locals. Don’t stay in one place for too long. Don’t ignore that growl you hear in the night. Oh, and just in case you forget... try not to starve.  Highly Recommended ","hours":15.3,"funny_percent":0.06315789473684211,"helpful_percent":0.8631578947368421}

Whether it be the overall gameplay, the lore, the deaths, the nomming, the insanity, or having your base burnt down because of one lightning strike in Spring, the game delivers on all of what it promises and more.

{"review":"This game is so addictive, while trying not to starve on the game you may starve in real life, you won't sleep and you will go insane keeping your charactor alive.  This should come with a health warning but the games name should be a reminder in itself, maybe add an ingame timer that saves the game and tells the player 'eat and go to bed' after they've been playing 20 hours.

{"review":"What is Don't Starve all about?  Don't Starve is a survival horror game that drops the character in an open and fully explorable world filled with numerous monsters and many interactive objects. This is a must buy for anyone who enjoys a game where the player is given total freedom to do what they want, how they want and when they want. So as a player and big fan here is my own personal experience on such an awesome single player experience game.   J20Hawkz Personal Opinion  I have been playing this game since early release and still find it extremely hard to stop playing it. Personally for me I enjoy adventure, action and rpg, Don't Starve combines all three in a unique way and blends in survival horror and a sort of farming, resource hoarding element also. If you enjoyed playing games such as Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon you will definitely feel right at home playing this. The added twist is you are always on your feet to make sure you don't go insane and lose health. Oh and of course don't starve.   Seasons, Days, Interactions  Almost everything can be interacted with, from catching small butterflies and bees to having epic battles with huge lumbering monsters that hunt you in the coldest and hardest of times. Yes Don't Starve has seasonal changes, and not only do you live to survive, you must survive to live. Days go from light to dark, they don't last very long making it all important you do enough to survive the dark night and start again when the sun comes out. Anything that moves and would potentially pose a threat can harm the player if you choose to get too close or in some way anger it.   Weapons, Traps, Armour, Food  Craft weapons, armour, traps and walls to defend yourself against continuous threat. Capture, kill, gather and cook food to make sure your hunger never drops. Everything you see can be used to collect valuable resources that will be used to craft hundreds of helpful survival items.   Explore a living world  Not only are we free to explore a fairly large open map, we can also go deeper into the caves and explore a strange and creepy ancient world. With the addition of such levels Don't Starve replay ability went through the window. Again exploring either the world above ground or venturing deep into the darkness of the caves, is all up to the player. There are no strings attached. You do as you wish.   Minor Issues  There are some minor faults with the game, but the team behind this game are very supportive and at least one member is on hand to help sort out any technical issues or those annoying bugs we encounter while playing. Never have I seen a more committed development team than Klei. Most questions can be answered by reading the community made Don't Starve Wiki, you can also visit the Official Klei site and post questions or reply to other friendly members of the Don't Starve community. The Steam Don't Starve forum is also a good place to share or ask what's on your mind.   Death  Death can be a pain, if you die that's it, you have to start all over again. The further you get is based on the number of days survived. However you gain experience points based on this number that is used to unlock other playable characters all of which have unique aspects about them. There are ways of avoiding a permanent game ending death so not all hope is lost.   Play alone or together  Don't Starve was originally planned as a Single player game only. On the 6th of May 2014 multiplayer was announced for late summer 2014. More to follow.   Finally  All in all, this game is a great single player oriented experience. The achievements we get is what we find hard and over come. With no online capabilities or steam associated achievements, some may find this game not worth buying. However if those are the only negatives in a game you will be hard pressed to find something that is as captivating as Don't Starve.   I give this game a solid 85/100.  Here is just one example of what can be made in Don't Starve.    Don't Starve  A Screenshot of Don't Starve By: J20Hawkz ","hours":139.7,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.8623188405797102}
{"review":"> Started game. Chased by wolves into the darkness. I died.  > New game. Got hungry, tried to steal Tallbird egg. Tallbird didn't like that. I died.  > New game. Getting the hang of things. Tried to pick a harmless eyeball-shaped plant. Plant wasn't harmless. I died.  > New game. Found Touchstone, learned to abuse savestate mechanics. Dying becomes nearly impossible.  > Winter came. I died.  Don't Starve is a creepy-cute survival game in which you're made to learn through mistakes, and in which the slightest mistake can kill you and erase all your progress. I'm currently 74 days into a run, but not without a little abuse of the game mechanics. Don't Stave is a hard rogue-like, in that the instant you die your entire world and all your progress is erased, but there are a couple resurrection items in each world that let you respawn once after death, and I've found that there's a few seconds between dying and resurrection in which you can safely quit the game without it saving over your file. Basically, it's the old Pokemon trick: if you accidentally kill the legendary, just reboot your save file and everything's fine.  Is this cheating? Probably. Kind of. Not as much as the time I played through this game's entire adventure mode with God Mode turned on because I so badly wanted the character you unlock at the end. (I know, I'm THAT kind of player. In my defense, the adventure mode of this game is just absurd.)  I've put more hours into this game than into all my other games combined, and I think that fact alone should show how fun it is. It's a sandbox game, in that there are no set objectives, but there are so many things to do in the game that forming your own objectives is easy and natural; it's pretty obvious when you run across something you haven't accomplished yet (surviving through winter; unlocking the Magic tab; collecting the parts to the Teleportato), and in order to accomplish it, you usually have to master some new aspect of the game. In my current save file, I have: survived two winters; walked around the entire overworld map; hunted down MacTusk; survived (and slain) the mighty Deerclops; and built a base with six farms, two bee boxes, and a nearby spider den, which I'm pretty sure could sustain me indefinitely without me having to move beyond my line of berry bushes. All this and I've still only scratched the surface. (Literally; there's a whole cave world below the surface world, and a ruin world below that, which I've only read about so far.)  The only downside to this game is the roguelike element, in that every time you die you have to start over. But the randomly-generated world makes starting over kind of fun, especially with the option to try new characters, and once you have the basic survival tools there's a million directions you can go in, most of which you won't have touched in previous playthroughs.   I will say, however, that the dying does get annoying, especially when so many of your deaths feel like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Like those eyeball plants that attacked and killed me before I could figure out what they were. Or the wolves, which will NEVER stop chasing you, or even give you time to craft something to defend yourself. Or all those times a monster attacked my campsite at night, forcing me to run in circles around my fire as the light slowly burned out. Basically, if at any moment you aren't prepared for everything, it probably means you're about to die. The only reason I can ignore this is that I would quickly quit my game whenever I was about to die, but without cheats, the permadeath mechanic makes progress in this game infuriatingly difficult (but incredibly rewarding when it does happen).  I'd give it an 8/10. (10/10 if savestate abuse is counted as a game mechanic.)","hours":52.5,"funny_percent":0.06666666666666667,"helpful_percent":0.9866666666666667}
