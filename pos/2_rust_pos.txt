Pros - Great concept - Stunning graphics - Game mechanics are great - The combat system is good - The crafting system is very good - Weekly updates! Which is one of the most important things for an Early Access game! - Good and serious developers, who listen to the community - Modding is easy, and the community has almost full access to modding - Skins  Cons - Not optimised for extreme potato users, but that is not a main problem i.m.o - The community can be cancerous at times, but that is life! Not everyone you meet will be nice or help you! - Server creation is a little complicated, but if you are stubborn enough you will learn how to do it / manage it ","hours":318.4}

All I have is a rock.. I'm scared. There seems to be no sign of other humans. I do not have any food or shelter yet, however, I was able to obtain a few logs by hitting a tree with this rock multiple times.. What a mysterious island.  Day 2  I have found a chicken, some more wood, and a few stones, I was able to conceive an amateur, handmade axe, it only took a few seconds to make, so I was able to kill the chicken too. I have also gathered a fairly large pile of wood, I might be able to build a makeshift shelter, but for now... Tonight I feast.  Day 3  Today is the day, I will finally build a shelter, I can feel the warmth of a warm bed and fire already. I haven't felt this good since I was a child, playing with my toys, I remember one toy more than most, it was called a \"Steam\", ahh, the good ol' days. I will be home soon.  I promise.  Day 4  I'm sorry. I have killed a man. It all happened so fast, he was holding a gun, I was debating on making peace with him, but he seemed the brutal sort. And all of his gear, it was... Enticing. He must have had a family, but I am becoming selfish it seems, I don't care about the man that I have killed. All that I can think of is one thing, not my family, not his family... But tonight I feast.  Day 5  I've come across a small, abandoned town, there seems to be a lot of loot within the area. The only problem is that I obtain a heavy dose of radiation if I go into the barriers. I have a choice: Obtain what's necessary to survive and die from radiation, or live on how I am now.. In poverty. I think I'll live. Just for a while longer.  Day 6  I saw a man today, outside of my cabin, he was naked and he had a rock.. He seemed to have been yelling incomprehensible jibberish, he must be insane.. I remember when I was like that. I still am in a way.  Day 7  I don't know what to do. The man that I saw yesterday came into my cabin while I was asleep, he held a rock to my head and struck.. My life flashed before my eyes, stupid reflex, I grabbed my journal. Remember when I said that I was coming home? Sadly my dear, you'll have to meet me in heaven. I am bleeding out. I am in god's hands now.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  \"HEY ROBERT, I FOUND SOME D0UCHE'S DIARY!\"  \"HAHA, WHAT AN IDIOT!

{"funny_percent":0.0010666666666666667,"helpful_percent":0.7216370471715307,"review":"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote \"Sorry guys :D\" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be \"shoot-on-sight?\" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players.   All in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.","hours":13.3}

(They will run up walls if they feel like it)  Controversial Features • Sleeper servers (Even when you log off you are still in-game, and able to be killed. Pretty much forces you put in time to build a stable base before leaving the server. Or risk being killed.  Relateable Games • H1Z1 • The Forest  • DayZ  Conclusion Rust can be a very fun survivial game, especially with friends. I put \"DayZ\" as a relateable game, but let me assure you they are two different games and should never be compared, other than them having a survival aspect. Rust can sometimes feel very slow pace on the official servers, so If you want to quickly build and join in on the action, id suggest a modded server with faster crafting and gathering. Overall, if you have the money, i'd suggest looking into buying this game. It is currently in Alpha, so really look into it before purchasing.   Score 60/100  (If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!)","hours":113.5}
{"funny_percent":0.046468401486988845,"helpful_percent":0.7317122145944066,"review":"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Before you scroll down and read the rest.. let me say one thing: \"Rust is a high risk, high reward -type of game, if you get salty every time you die.. then move along.. this game isn't for you\". _______________________________  General game information  This game is a great example of a survival sandbox game. You can literaly do whatever the hell you wanna do. Do you wanna roleplay? Go for it. Do you wanna build stuff and let your creative mind blow of some steam? Go for it. Do you wanna murder another player in cold blood with your trusted rock? Go for it.  Obviously there are populair ways (PVP) to play the game but when you spawn in this game.. naked and along on a beach.. armed with a rock and torch.. with nothing holding you back.. you will realise why you woke up on the beach in the first place. _______________________________  My experience  At the time of writing this review i've been playing this game for years. It started out with a mate of mine buying the game. I was watching him through some streaming software and I thought it looked fun. So I bought it. After figuring out the basics of crafting and resource gathering the two of us started building a wonderful base. That base lasted for a full hour. Then we were severly punished for the flaws in our design by a more experienced player. This happened over and over and over and over again. At this point a lot of people lose interest in the game, I didn't. For some reason I was determined to learn from my previously made mistakes and improve on them. This resulted in over 1800 hours of gameplay. 1800 of GLORIOUS hours. But like I said earlier, this game isn't for the feint of heart. _______________________________  State of the Game  When you invest a little into this game physically and emotionally.. you will run into people referring to \"Legacy\" being the best state of the game, I disagree. The current version of Rust is a combination of two previously tested systems of the game. These are named: The Blueprint system + The component system. Most Rust players will tell you that the blueprint system was the best system this game has ever seen. Over the last few years them tried different systems which generally didn't get any love. A week ago (at the time of me posting this review) They revamped the system to the one I mentioned earlier. The Blueprint system + The component system - Aka the best system Rust has ever seen + new features of older failed systems revamped. _______________________________  The pros If you use a microphone, you will have the most fun and random interactions you have ever experienced. There's a lot of ways to express your creativity. Basebuilding, gearsets, drawing penisses on other peoples bases. There is no real endgame, so you can set your own goals. Trust me when I say that those can be very rewarding. Its a great game for Youtube content (has profanity filter, auto censoring nudes ect.) Its a great game for Twitch content (has a streamer mode to hide from streamsnipers, has profanity filter, auto censoring nudes ect.) As a big community that really loves the game, but for the most part is filled with toxic players. (Like any other game these days) The game is constantly being developed. Weekly changes+additions with every patch. The game also has a great Dev team, they are hardworking and very dedicated  The cons It has a big learning curve. The first thing you need to do is join a empty server and start figuring stuff out cause on a populated server you will get punished for it. A lot of people KoS in the current state of the game, which is fine for me cause im used to it. But if you are new it can be very offputting. The game has a very annoying memoryleak that will cause problems no matter how much GB you got in that godlike computer of yours. (they are working on it) Deciding on the correct server for you to join will directly affect how much fun the game is for you as a soloplayer. The official servers are terrible. There is hardly ever a admin in there to counteract a possible cheater. My advice: Stick to the community servers. The game uses a day/night cycle. During the night it truly is pitchblack and you wont be able to see a thing. Unless you have Nvidia, then you can just fire up the gamma and you'll be fine. Especially vs people that have a AMD graphics card. Its a annoying problem in the game thats currently being looked into. _______________________________  The future isn't set in stone.  Well, sorta. If you take a look at the facepunch website you will be able to see a roadmap. On this roadmap you will be able to find features and fixes they lined up for the game. Some will be added shortly and some will probably never see the light of day. Keep in mind the game is currently still early access and might change drasticly in a year. I've seen the game go through 3-4 different systems now. And all of them had fun aspects and negative ones. _______________________________  Conclusion  If you are still interested after reading all this, definately buy the game. Over the years of me playing Rust, I've had the most interesting interactions and the most fun experiences ive ever had in a game. _______________________________  Side note  I'm working on a really big tutorial for this game. So if you are interested in that.. please check out my profile and subscribe to my youtube page. If not, I hope this review helped you a bit. Im not a professional reviewer or anything of the sorts. I'm just giving you my two cents about the game.","hours":1806.5}

Within 3 minutes of my first time playing, a bear ate me. Then I watched two other players club each other to death with large stones, while completely naked,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(penii?) dangling in the wind. Having managed to slay a small pig, I fashioned some clothes to cover my genitals, then went exploring.  Ate some uncooked meat and threw up all over the place. Made a small fire to cook the rest of my meat. Fashioned a bow and arrow out of some wood I collected, also a shirt and a pair of boots. Went about fashioning a small shelter out of some random crap laying around so I wouldn't have to sleep outdoors. I could have chosen from one of the many, many, ramshackle structures dotting the landscape. But those may or may not belong to/contain other players. Who may or may not be armed or clothed. I just wanted to peacefully live alone, so I stuck to the wilderness.  I slipped off a cliff and broke both my legs. I shouted out to anyone who would listen, asking what to do to fix my broken legs, I didn't understand the game and I needed help. A naked man came over, typed '??? i help' in response to my pleas, then bashed my head in with a rock and presumably looted my corpse.  Then I starved to death when I forgot to eat. Out of desperation I butchered a wolf that attacked me instead of running away, but didnt have time to cook so I ate raw meat again. Nope. Instead of just starving to death, I vomited, then starved to death.  Its now 7:25 am and many adventures later, I've decided to sleep in a small shack I made myself in the mountains. Don't dare risk making a fire, someone might see it at night and kill me for the tin of baked beans I got off a zombie I found wandering around a town that gave me radiation poisoning. Oh yeah, I'll probably die slowly because of the radiation, but thats a problem for later-me.  In a tiny hut on a mountain with my sleeping bag and meager belongings after 12 hours of playing straight, I can probably safely say I'm enjoying this game.","hours":135.2}

I have been playing Video Games since PAC-MAN hit the game rooms, so when I say this game is unique and different from all the games that I have played before, please don't think that I exaggerate. I got frustrated or raged in games before but I have never had a big adrenalin rush before or had a cocktail of many different feelings in a game before. The first week of Rust burned into my memory, remembering running scared and losing myself in the game, it was too much. It was a Love & Hate, for which I kept coming back. You can become a hero or rich in a second and lose it all in another second and you can become the villain you despised so much. You will meet horrible people and great ones. With Rust, my game expectations changed so much that I can't play single-player games for very long now. I used to be lone gamer, but this game made me buy headphones with a microphone, my friend list went from 0 to 30. I started following YouTubers. I learned new words. I am not that salty anymore against toxic players, PvP became a norm, PvE became fun, going deep became a goal… It even had effect on my life that possession became more irrelevant - that this game showed me everything is fleeting over and over again. There is love, anger, betrayal, revenge, and all kind of roleplay… and I have grown in it.","hours":1922.4}

I told myself I would wait to do this review, that I would let it settle, that it would one day be finished and then I could write my thoughts. Well, too much time has passed for me to wait any longer, and for some reason, today seems to be the day.  I'm not even sure now how I discovered this, \"new game with a cool idea\". A friend, DayZ-exploring, a flashing Steam store page, who knows. But once I installed it, and loaded it up, I had found a new, exciting video game. The music when loading was incredible, eerie and atmospheric; and this was 'alpha' music? Once I loaded into the world, an island of apparently great size, I enjoyed the experience from the start. Nature, trees, vast distances, animals, ruins, and...people.  For that is what makes Rust tick, people. The first moment, not knowing whether to hide, fight, or try to communicate, is telling, and this is a common thread. And with these first moments, come the first deaths, both expected and not. And so comes the first rule of Rust, don't trust anyone. And with this rule comes the choice you have to make, do you strive to live a solo life? Do you have Steam friends that play and can band together? Or do you try to find some team to take you in? Be ready, you are going to die, a lot.  I made a shelter, and built, and harvested, and hunted. I ventured into dangerous places and survived. Or died. In the end, it was a great experience. Then came the version changes, at first it was good, bugs were fixed. Then, they started over from scratch, and things started getting different from what made it good in the first place. It was good, then bad, then good, then bad.  The game today is worse than it was, a new thing we are seeing in games when they are made to be a service. A game with a golden age, something we used to only see in MMOs. That is why I can no longer recommend this game. I am going to give it a thumbs up, because of my experiences, and that it was worth the money I paid, but now is a different time. Rust is over for me.  Graphics:  Apart from certain updates and small periods, Rust has always looked fantastic. As they moved into Beta and the modern Rust era, the game both looks great, and takes a great system to run. It's one of the games that gets my PC as hot as it can get. Beware!  Sound: Great music and sounds at first, but inconsistent sound production. Seemed like the staff never settled on consistant sounds/music during the process. To me, this shows a lack of focus, which has been clear from every player since the beta started. This developmental blurriness seems to coincide with when Rust had already made huge sales. Pretty much the team had success, and just went in slow-patch mode. It was less about a work of art, a work that could have defined the team of producers and developers for the rest of their lives, and more about making the project akin to updating the software in automatically flushing toilets.  Community: It's a multiplayer game, and the community can be tight-knit if you're in good, but overall it's as toxic as it gets. The sadness with Rust comes from both the community and the developers. Nobody is happy, ever. This has bred conflict between players I've never witnessed before. In short, Rust has the worst community of players I have ever seen, and the clear lack of maturity in most players is almost depressing.  Overall:  Rust was a pioneer, and flagship in a tattered lot, but what made it great also destroyed it. When new games are made in its shadow, I hope that someone can capture that essence just once again, and hold it tight until a perfect time to share it with the world.","hours":1228.5}

I ran around, looking for a fellow survivor. After an hour, I saw him. I yelled at him as loud as I could, and he turned around.   We greeted each other, and agreed to work together.  After a few days, we'd built a house, and had enough supplies to last a week. We had weapons, food and water. Life was good.  One day, on our daily raid, we spotted someone. He was naked, and ran towards us. He greeted us, we greeted him back, and he and I started a conversation. Suddenly, my friend pulls me back and whispers to me. He said we should kill him. Survival of the fittest.  I looked back at the innocent man and gave him my pickaxe and told him to leave. My friend sighed, and gave him some clothes. He thanked us, and left.   The next day, he appears again, to say thanks, and that he has a gang as well, so that we could join him. We kindly refused. He sounded a bit agitated, but he said no problem, and left.  Later that night, I hear footsteps outside our house. My friend was fast asleep, so I grabbed my homemade shotgun and looked outside.  It was the man. The man who we gave a pickaxe to. He was inspecting our house with someone else, but quickly left after he saw a bear running towards him.  The next morning, I woke up my friend and told him what happened. He told me I shouldn't have trusted him, and that war is coming.  I was raiding an old town, when suddenly on top of a hill in the distance, I saw him. Although this time, he had his gang. There were a lot of them. About 10-20. My friend noticed this as well, and told me to get inside. We got inside, and it was quiet for about an hour. My friend and I go outside, and see them waiting.  They said that they were friendly, but we didn't trust them. My friend and I got out our shotguns and told them to leave. They didn't listen.   Then the war began.  They got out guns and shot at us, firing at all directions. My friend got hit, and yelled at me to get inside and lock the door. My friend barely got inside, but when he did, it was already to late- they were inside.  Luckily, we had a panic room for this kind of situation. It had an iron door, which could only be broken down by C4. We rushed down there as the scavengers began to search our house.  After a few minutes, they'd discovered we were in the panic room, so they began swinging at it with the pickaxe I gave them. It didn't work. When suddenly, I heard a boom. They had C4.  My friend and I discussed what we should do. We agreed that when we get taken hostage, we run like hell.  They eventually got in, took all of our gear, and we were naked again. They were about to execute us when suddenly, my friend got up and began to run. He ran as fast as the wind would take him. They missed every shot they took at him, so I decided I had nothing to lose, so I ran as well.   It was pitch black outside. I felt around and felt a bush, so I hid in there. In the distance, I could see torches everywhere. My friend saved my life, but the enemy was searching for him. There was nothing I could do, so I ran off, and began my new life.  To this day, I don't know what my friend is doing. Dead or alive, he's a hero. The enemy army got raided by an even stronger group, and me?  I'm surviving.  Stories like this make Rust such a good game. It truly is an experience. I highly recommend this game. Although the glitches are a bit annoying, you get used to it.  9/10","hours":247.7}

NOTE that I have 1500 hours put into this game on my main account plus a few more on this account so im a long time rust player. Now on to my story and experience.   MONTH 1-2  There i was in the open field trying to figure out how to craft and make stuff. First shack I built I thought I was safe, no I was just a prey for players. They tore my shack down and told me if I wanted a room. Without clear thinking i said yes and soon after they trapped me in there house and I was made a slave. I joined another server and with a minutes I made myself a pipe-shotgun wooo!!!. As I went to farm i noticed 3 guys loaded with gear and heavy artillery. I thought this was a caveman game with no high tech weaponry, nope i was wrong when they shot that bullet in my face. Though i loved everything this game had going. A week passes and I find a hidden somewhat made base and without thinking again make my room right on top and start farming and making new things. Next day I wake up to find 2 guys building on top of the base I made and we have a short stare until they said they are sorry. They thought the base was abandoned. As I return from my farming routine I find a player stealing my stuff from the bottom part which I was going to use. His name was lunch I took it to shoot him right away, but he shuts the door and managed to stay safe. We soon talked it out and made an agreement not to shoot each other. I trusted him and that was the start of a new friendship.   MONTH 2-3  My roomates on top dissapeared out of nowhere and in the end it was me and lunch. We did what any rust player does survive and find new things to make. Then we found a player named tanaka. He was a fellow rust player and could make bolt rifles so we made a deal to offer a trade. after the trade me and lunch were thinking, shoot...kill... I chose not to shoot him. The three of us form an alliance and go out hunting for people and yes its the most fun satisfying thing in RUST and I hate it. Everything was perfect until we encountered them. A hacker out of nowhere aimbotted us and from then on we were careful to go outside with valuable stuff because you never know when they will decide to aimbot you. That didn't stop me and lunch until a hacker found our base one day. Turned out he was a little boy and wanted our codes to our house. We said no and he aimbotted us and destroyed everything we had and took so long farming for. That is when we decided to go to a community server as we said bye to the rust players and tanaka.   MONTH 3-4  Nothing much to say but we just enjoyed our new rust community hacker free or so we thought. Even though there are admin there is a 50% chance that there is a hacker hiding his hacks or clipping inside houses when admin is gone. It was a fun time as me and lunch made new friends and enemies. Though as time went on less players showed up and thats when my good friend lunch left the game RUST. There i was alone but couldn't leave this damn game as i loved it so much. Yes i went back to the official servers and once started from scratch, or so i thought....   MONTH 4-9  There i spawned i saw the one person i remembered, the one I didn't shoot, the one me and lunch hunted with. Tanaka{Robin}. He offered me a bed and my own room and we chatted for awhile and thus i told him about lunch . Days went to weeks and weeks went to months and slowly me and robin were building more bases and trusting each other with our items. We decided to spend all our wood on at the hanger and thus in a few weeks the batcave was born. During these times i also gained reputation good and bad. Most loved me and I made more friends who would later help me with my enemies. Those that were my enemies called me nothing but a low hacker hiding my hacks. My other sort of rival to own lands was a clan named RST and a few encounters i had with them i shot without any say. Then came another man who i would get to know more as the days went one. His name was doc baby ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I didn't really talk to him that much but enjoyed his say when a plane dropped an airdrop. ZE PLANE ZE PLANE. Me and robin didn't see him that much as he was in the other side of the map but he was an enjoyment. Everything was normal each day in RUST. Nakeds players, friends, hackers and more. FYI Doc refers the nakeds as hobos. Even later I slowly made friends with RST and respected them. REP(incinerator,pie,maddy). Then the horrible day came as me and robin encountered the servers first wipe.   Month 9-11  My love for Rust didn't make me leave,which i hate. NO, instead i went to another server and Rst was nice enough to lend me a small room. Heck i even saw doc and his ZE PLANE ZE PLANE. Robin was with me but made a different base and in that short time EA3 was back and everybody returned. Though not everybody I once knew were there as some of my friends and allies left Rust. It wasn't long until Yes even Robin left right when the server came back up. You will be missed. Thus it was me and my rock. Though there i was addicted to this damn game playing and playing. The batcave was rebuilt,hackers were doubling and players started to vanish because of hackers. there i went solo for a while then one day Doc visited my base and introduced my to Mr ROtten. We went out to kill hobos and later i gave them a guest room. I enjoyed their company and they are one main reason why i stayed in rust more. From friendly player i was turned into an asshat, No we turned to ZE Asshats. I trusted even more and gave them the codes to my entire batcave and so came the chapter of me and the asshats. Then out of nowhere it came again, dam servers.   MONTH 11-PRESENT  New server new fresh start and new players. Me Doc and Rotten made a T tower and do what we do best which is snipe hobos. Its been a year and few months now and i'm slowly players are coming back though i'm not sure ill stay here any longer. I've been raided,c4ed, no clipped, befriended, Shot etc.. I have raided, killed, c4ed, and have done it all. I know every trick that rust has and still could possibly learn more things. RUST is a game that shows how you feel about players and what you are willing to do to survive. Rust has one main story and that is your story. I love this and and hate it at the same time. I will never forget how many friends i have made and friends that have left me. who knows i might have an encounter with them again. This is my Story and history in RUST. I hope you will give this game a chance as developers are even making a new RUST. Thankyou and remember the name of the game is RUST not TRUST(sometimes).  Yar.... ","hours":283.6}

Here is my story.  - I met a man who helped me when I started my adventures in this beautiful island. He helped me out since I was a newbie, he fed me chicken that came from a cow, sheltered me in a wooden house that I couldn't escape from and he protected me from the wolves I tried to pet. Once I finally understood the game, he released me into the wild, I took a few steps into the open and BOOM I got shot in the back by him. I respawned at camp and beat him up with a rock, took his stuff and ran off happily ever after.  10/10 MUST BUY  EDIT: The man has captured me once again, but this time, my knowledge has advanced. I entered his fortress willingly, but little did he know, I was an evil mastermind. He took me as one of his \"crew members\". Along with 2 other people, we journeyed and raided other buildings.

{"funny_percent":0.7922912205567452,"helpful_percent":0.9364448244686339,"review":"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I've had Rust for a week at the time of writing this review / guide. I have 50hrs at this point. What follows is a review of the various stages of your rust play-through, from wipe to wipe.  In the beginning: - You are given a randomly generated character, and spawn naked and afraid.  I am a black male, finally I can use BBC in my online rust dating profile. *If you can't handle this point, do not pass begin, do not collect 200 wood, GTFO.   - You have a rock and a torch, they are used to bash trees, animals, rocks and hordes of preteen nakeds that chase, and kill you for no reason. Be careful! Trust no squeakers! And if you come across someone who doesn't kill you right away...BE CAREFUL! They are cunning and probably have a deeper, more mature psychopathic nature.   - Once you gather enough wood for spears, stuck a few naked preteens to death, and move your way up the food chain, you'll need a place to stash your goodies. Location is very important, you will need access to basic resources like fresh water, stone and wood, but also isolated enough to not attract the older, more geared players that will level your base and put you in the middle of their circle jerk while chanting \"whats good ma dude\" to completion before killing you...Then picking you up saying \"sorry brah, my bad, sorry man, want to join us?\" IT'S A TRAP! They will kill you after 5 seconds whether you respond or not.  - Now after getting your♥♥♥♥♥♥pushed into the dirt a couple of times, or in my case, an impressive BBC (A couple times being an understatement) you will establish a little 2 x 2 house that's quite isolated, some food in the chest, a nice pickaxe, hatchet and a roaring furnace. You might even be so lucky as to have a friendly neighbor. Well done, you have made it further than you would have for about 10 hrs of your initial gameplay. Don't let this discourage you from getting the game though! Or do, you salty noob.   The Middle:  - Now that you've ticked off two to three of Maslow's tiers it's time to have some fun.  - You will need to grow your arsenal and this can be done in a few ways depending on your skill set: a) Do you like exploring and avoiding danger? Night time rad town runs might be for you! b) Do you like adrenaline rushes and close calls with death? Killing geared players on their rad town runs might be for you! c) Do you enjoy asserting your dominance over others, puffing up your own ego over those that clearly are helpless against it? Raiding the nakeds might be for you! *use of the \"What's good ma dude?\" slogan is optional. d) Are you a PVP god and enjoy using the terms \"Get Rekt\" and \"360 no scope\"? Raiding other big boy clans might be for you! *A YouTube channel to upload tutorials on how to 1 v 5 is optional.  - Expect to get raided! No matter how isolated you are, how strong you think you are or how many slaves you've forced into hard labor on your hemp farm, there will come a time when you get raided. If you are lucky, your base could hold them off for long enough while you and your human shield of slaves fight them off, with all your cleverly placed traps, your double stacked foundations and your triple stacked walls. In most cases, however, you will get a rather efficient, high pressured♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that will usually take place when you are out shopping IRL.  - The aftermath of a raid: Once you come back to an empty house, you will go through the five stages of loss. Namely denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. The only part we will discuss is acceptance, provided you didn't destroy your PC in stage 2. There are really only 4 options after a raid, and that again is dependent on your skill set: Type a) players: Pick up your sleeping bag, if you still have it, and jog on.  Type b) players: Learn the weak spots of your base, rebuild, and hope your online next time they come so that you can defend yourself. Type c) players: Find a naked, take over their base and relocate. It is very important that you wait for the poor naked to come back to the base and beg for some of their gear back, make sure you only reply with \"Why so salty\" before giving some gear back, and then proceeding to kill them. Type d) players: This is what stirs your coffee! Call your boi's and start recording! It's time to make a counter raid video!  -The end:  Regardless of the server you choose, one thing is certain. All maps will eventually wipe. All your hard work, all the times you've laughed, you've cried, it all gets wiped like the blackboard of your maths class. What was it all for? What did you learn? Was it worth it? Will I ever use that knowledge in the future?  In short. No.  There is only a brief moment in time when you will be on top, or at the bottom, depending on your preference. One thing is for certain though, whatever you choose, it feels GOOOOOOOOD. I can best sum it up as a heroin rush, followed by addiction and hatred for yourself and your life choices.  If you're gonna buy Rust because of this review, and you didn't type TLDR, then welcome!  *Edit: I've now been re-rolled as an asian dude. I no longer have BBC rights, I now have a micro♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is a sad day for all my honies.","hours":483.2}

In Rust you may choose to play alone or with others to survive, build, and loot. The game is at its best on its community servers as the official ones tend to be overly crowded and very intense for a beginner. In Rust you spawn in a random area of the very large map with nothing at your disposal but a rock, a torch, and bandages (Depending on the Server). With that rock you begin your seemingly overwhelming journey of gathering supplies, supplies allow you to create tools, and buildings. From there most players choose to explore their surroundings and upgrade their defenses.   This game while enthralling is a time consumer and requires a lot of your attention, other players can kill you and loot your corpse. I've spent hours upon my intitial spawn working in a community of players building a small city and upgrading to metal walls. We traded supplies, hunted together, looted nearby rad towns, and even slowly accepted new players into our ranks. Our small group had become a society, we aided those who needed help and defended our small city from other players masked as bandits. We had come to know each other by first names and trusted that our things be safe while not ingame, as there was always another player on watching over your city.   This game is perhaps the first game to create a challenging but engaging true to life experience. Things I had never experienced in a game before such as trying to decide amongst your fellow founding members if the lone newbie could be trusted behind our walls? Do we let him in? Should we make him bunk in the Newbie quarters overnight until he pulls his own weight? Are our walls truly safe? Who should be allowed to carry rifles? How can we expand our society and truly be able to keep our loot safe? All of these questions come into play at any given point.   Play with the right people, on the right server, and you too can have this experience. As for that society? What led to our unavoidable demise? One lone player trusted behind our walls was able to level everything in just a few hours. That is part of the game though, that experience, is what defined for me what games should be aiming to deliver a one of a kind experience I can experience nowhere else.   Your experience may vary, your story may differ, but mine definitely enables me to recommend this game to the average player.   If you enjoy working hard at something, having a totally different survival experience, definitely buy this game.   *I can't recommend this to someone who enjoys a quick shooter game or fast paced experience, it is slow but the rewards are so much greater.","hours":75.6}

{"funny_percent":0.125,"helpful_percent":0.9331284836533617,"review":"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I got somewhat 500 hours in this game and i just decided to write a review for it.  Game has a lot of potential, some of it hidden. Rust is better played in a group of 3 to 5 on a medium or big server with constant rivals at your doors and glitches on your back. It's been in early access for quite some time now but unlike other games, this one actually has updates (weekly). Devs aren't afraid to change gameplay mechanics to see how it plays out in the end, this is Early Access after all. So, how's the game up close?  Gameplay is simple in its basics. Just survive. Kill, build (optionally, tho, you can even survive without a base), farm (a lot, especially if you're alone) and do whatever you want. Currenly, as of beginning of 2017 there is no end-game content or any specific objective to do. Most people tend to raid once they have reached a certain level of development; some just build the biggest and baddest base around and stay in it, occasionally killing someone from their roof and most of the players are engaged in pvp content, whether they want it or not. No one is protected from having his аss handed to him just because he made a wrong turn in the forest and walked up on a gang of 3 ruskies with ak's and full armor. This is why the game is best played in group, that way you can have an actual objective in game - to have fun together, instead of just building a base or raiding someone.  Graphics, optimisation, all of that are changing constantly and for some the game would be unplayable, but that's only if you have a very old pc. Currenly, i'd have about 40 fps on high on r9 270x and i5. But since it's early access and unity together, means that there are a lot of bugs and nothing can save you if you suddenly freeze during a firefight. Happens occasionally.  Sound - eh, it's alright. Music - eh, turned it off.  Social interactions - knock a door, press V and scream SUKA ♥♥♥♥♥ SUDA IDI NAHOOY, get rekt.  Potential - a lot, if devs keep on updating as they are, game will (probably... hopefully) leave ea with a lot of content and ready to conquer steam charts.","hours":635.3}

Yes, but only if you know what you're getting yourself into.  Well, first off, Rust is a game of \"Survival\". But their definition of survival is... well... different. To be bluntly honest, the nature of the game encourages and rewards you for being an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. For a game that plops you naked on a beach with nothing but a rock, there are alot of guns and powerful weapons players can get easily and very early on. The game appears to cater to clan and group wars, which I'll admit, makes for some excellent videos. But the fact of the matter is most people (myself included) don't want to play that way. This game becomes a HUGE investment of your time as typically, it will require hours to build a \"raid-proof\" home. And once your home is finished, you'll look out at the beautiful sunset and log off, confident your hard work has paid off, despite the fact that your home is only 30% actual home and the other 70% is pure armor. But when you log in less than 24 hours later, you find yourself waking up on noob beach. Because for every hour you spent building your home, some prick has spent double that left clicking the attack button with one hand while furiously fapping with the other to wreck your hard work. But if you can manage to build a good home on a good server, the game can be a very rewarding experience.  Rust for me had alot of disappointing, infuriating moments, which often keeps me from coming back to play. But it also had alot of great moments. The act of logging on alone was an anxiety, waiting at the loading screen wondering if I've been killed or if I was still safe. The intense feelings of paranoia from the presence of other players and of protecting my home. The adrenaline rushes of being shot at, and of going on intense raid missions. The excitement of assassinating a powerful kingpin (who deserved it) or gunning down a warring maruader. And finally, the feeling of looking out the window of my beautiful home at a beautiful view of the sunset or a full moon on the ocean. A game has never before invoked as much emotion out of me as Rust has.  I would reccomend these tactics for staying alive: - Play \"Native American\" style. Plant your sleeping bag in a bush where no one will find it, and live a life of very little materialism. If you die or are robbed, you lost very little - Hide. Build your home where no one will find it. Consider sacrificing a fort for a smaller home. It will be easier to raid, but harder to find. Raiders will assume there is a bigger bounty inside a bigger fort, but might decide not to waste their time on a smaller home because they'll think you're poor. Stay far away from the West and East coasts (where new players generally spawn), away from the middle of the map, and away from the road and rad towns. Build next to clusters of big rocks, or terrain that would be unappealing for travel (for example, tundra), and never in the open. You will likely be found eventually, but I have had games where I was either never found or if I was, players just left me alone. And it will give you lots of time to estabilsh your hold.  - Play the game RIGHT after servers wipe so that you're the first person to start on a brand new island - TRUST NO ONE. You may find players that will like to trade or who will actually help you. But always practice your politics very carefully. Most players will shoot you on sight - Get a feel for the population of the server. I usually go to servers that appear abandoned and play alone for quite some time. Sometimes it works, sometimes the server suddenly becomes popular. You can refresh the server lists to constantly know how many people are on a server at all times. On rare occasions, you can find servers where the strongest players are friendly's who will actively hunt the kind of people who seek to ruin your day. You can collaborate with these people - Understand raid tactics. You can lock your door, but can they blow a hole in your window? Come in from the roof or the foundation? Did you destroy the stairs so no one can get up to you? Did you build a third floor in case they blow up the first floor ceiling? Did you armor the hell out of your cupboard so they can't build their way around? There are lots of things to consider, and the game is constantly updating in ways that require new strategies. - Raid a few homes yourself. I'm generally a peaceful player, but if I see someone setting up camp too close to my territory, I treat it like a threat. Because let's face it, it generally is. The players will eventually find your home if they haven't already, and you can't trust them not to come after you. Again, you can check the servers for population and you can scope out targets to determine if the player is currently online. Exploit weaknesses, get in, loot, and get out as fast as you can. Know how long the travel will take and take advantage of things such as the cover of night. Stay out of the road and weave through trees, bushes, and etc. Make sure no one sees you, catches your name, and make damn sure you aren't followed.   Good luck and happy hunting","hours":471.6}

I noticed faint shapes of other players in the distance..thinking \"oh♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; i scurried away. little did i know they saw me and started to chase me.  A few minuets later i made a wooden shack in the middle of an open plain, for me to sleep in. I awoke in the night to hear footsteps outside my door, scared and confused I peeked through the cracks of my shack.. Several naked men were trying to break into my house and loot me. Strange russian voices could be heard. A minuet or so later they broke into my shack and i made a run for it...In the persuit I was running as fast as i could, only to be shot down by a naked mans bow and arrow, a few seconds later they caught up to me and started to gangbang my nearly dead corpse, while beating me with rocks and making really strange sex noises.....i must say that this is the most realistic Russian prison simulator ever.  10/10?","hours":26.1}

Ask them to enjoy it with you! Together, it's much more fun.The first 2 ingame days maybe a pain, but with friends you can easily build things up.If you are more the \"solo survivalist\", no problem! Search for a hidden place, maybe behind some big or small mountains where its unlikely that someone in the next days will come.Build your little shelter for the first ingame week and begin to harvest wood to begin to build you dream survival house.Let's go hunting! First for animals, then for humans.Better don't run up the streets the first week without a gun.Things can change very fast.A sunny wood harvest day can easily be a struggle when doing so.But check it out yourself!

{"funny_percent":0.19696969696969696,"helpful_percent":0.7871739648939035,"review":"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Okay, so I have put about 200 hours into Rust and I'm going to write another review once I get more hours. So I'm going to tell you my experinces in Rust and if its worth your hard earned 20 bucks. So my friend had gotten Rust because he was tired of all the games he had and after a couple of days he recommded it to me. And I was like sure why the hell not. And boom! One of my current favorite games was born. Rust can get be frustrating most of the time. You WILL spend hard work and effort to make your little♥♥♥♥♥♥shack, and it WILL be wiped by a 8 man clan. Things like that will happen, even more now that the \"Twig Foundation\" update is out. But Rust can be very satisfying as well. For example, on one server this group of 3 raided my base and killed me. So in return, I got allied with a group of well armed people and raided and took over their base in return. Getting revenge is in my opinion the best part of this game. The game in general needs a bit of time to get used too. Controling the spray of your gun can get hard sometimes. But keep in mind the goal of this game is too survive and become the most powerful player on the server (Well thats my goal atleast), and people will betray you. Trusting someone is always a risk (unless you know them irl) but trusting people might be better than just killing the right off the bat.   Okay this review has gotten a bit too long so imma wrap things up. If your into games like ARK then this game will suit your needs. Playing alone is fun enough, but with friends is even more fun. Couple words of advice, don't trust strangers until you have formed some sort of a bond, nighttime is aids, stray clear of bears and wolves, and eoka pistol is god tier.","hours":288.8}
