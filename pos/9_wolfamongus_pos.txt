{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.9852431285617002,"review":"A mature story that takes place in a noir setting, The Wolf Among Us is a gritty take on various fairytale characters that have somehow escaped into our world and secretly living among us. You assume the role of Bigby Wolf \"The big bad wolf\". The first episode of the story has you involved in solving a murder mystery that has the appearance of leading to something much bigger.  The game follows the Telltale forumula used with their Walking Dead games. A narrative-driven story where your decisions have some impact on the outcome of certain story elements. One significant and welcome change that was added to The Wolf Among Us is that not only do the choices you make impact the outcome, but also WHEN you make some of the choices. This means that you can be presented with a decision of what order to do things and the order you choose will change how the story flows. This new feature will add some amount of replayability to the game because of the significant changes in narrative that result from the order of certain decisions.  The artwork follows a comic book style similar to Telltale's The Walking Dead games and the music is very well done and sets the tone for the game. I also liked the feature where you unlock various \"Book of Fables\" entries as you play the game. These entries will allow you to read more about the lore of the various characters and their backgrounds as they pertain to this story.  I really enjoyed playing the first episode of this game and looking forward to what the future episodes will bring!","hours":11.5}

At first, I want to say thanks to the developers for creating this amazing game. Telltale Games is a new branch of episodic games with point-and-click system. And, it looks awesome. You, guys, have created a great tale with an exciting plot and vivid characters. I like it.   The Wolf Among Us is a video game based on Fables comic book series, created by writer Bill Willingham. Our protagonist is Bigby, a.k.a. The Big Bad Wolf, sheriff of FableTown. He's extremely cunning and resourceful, in addition to being an excellent detective. Telltale Games have created an ideal sheriff moderately strict, but fair. Bigby is a true protector and savior of the city. I admire him.   Advantages: + Incredible storyline  + Interesting and charming characters  + Cinematic gameplay  + Strong and memorable protagonist  + Beautiful places of the city  + Constructive dialogues  + Amazing music   Disadvantages: - Not found   Conclusion: The Wolf Among Us is a fantastic, morally ambiguous detective tale, that exceeds expectations, providing an intriguing and thought-provoking adventure.  10/10.

You get sucked into the world of Fables, where well known Fable figures have to live in the human world, after escaping their home dimension, and you try as Sherriff Bigby Wolf (aka Big Bad Wolf) to not only solve a series of strange murders but also battle against your inner demons. For fans of the comic it offers a very interesting pre-story to where the series begins and you meet and get to know some characters, which were only shortly in the comics.  The graphics style fits the shrill world of Fables and the voice acting is once again nearly without flaw. Gameplay wise it is like the walking dead, more of an interactive movie than a true adventure, but it is done very well. Last but not least the music also fits perfectly.. from the well done intro with Bigby wandering through town up to the whole game, the \"Film Noir\" atmosphere is present everywhere.  As in any good of these detecive/Noir stories, it get´s rather dark and the borders between good and evil are easily shifted.","hours":9.4}

Yes it is better than the Walking Dead, better than their new Game of Thrones (which has a lot of potential). I  can't call anything Telltale does a game, because tbh there is not much gameplay at all. Its mostly an interactive story. It is more  about chosing dialouge options and minimal investigation than about ACTUAL gameplay. Which is fine, because I enjoy their ability to tell a good story.   Do not be fooled though, the game offers the illusion of choice, The game will end up happening the way it is intended to no  matter what you chose. The only thing is you have to choose  whether characters live or die, or if people hate you or not. The Choices in TWAU are quite good, and more than once you are given the choice of more than two options of what to investigate or chose. Which I like.   The characters are expertly voiced and acted. The music and  entire setting has a real Noir flair to it, which I was instantly in love with. This game has a fantastic story with an intriuging world full of mystery and excellent characters. Bigby Wolf the main character you play is one of my favorite protagonists second only to Geralt of Rivia.   That being said if you enjoy what Telltale does, this is its best work in my opinion. Most people will love Walking Dead more simply because it is the world that interests them more. If you want an interesting story with the best characters and a noirish plot and setting, pick this sucker up and enjoy.  Here is hoping for The Wolf Among Us Season 2 this year. 10/10","hours":10.6}

{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.9416837119608898,"review":"(TLDR? This review is also available in video format for your convenience below.)  Following the success of The Walking Dead, TellTale continues their tradition of interactive story based games with The Wolf Among Us. Based off the Fables graphic novels, the Wolf Among us follows Bigby Wolf the newly reformed big bad wolf and appointed sheriff of Fabletown, a community within New York City that houses a plethora of washed up fable characters. While enforcing the fabletown laws a series of events plunges Bigby into a murder investigation that involves the entire fable community where everyone is a suspect.  The interplay between the various characters is handled well with witty banter and humorous responses that take advantage of the history behind every citizen. Compared to the Walking Dead, the story moves along at a brisk pace with significantly less time spent in conversation hub areas requiring you to exhaust every option of interaction before being allowed to progress forward. The fantastic story is also strengthened by the clean comic book style of 1986 new york with a solid soundtrack complimenting Bigby's search for the truth.  There are occasional fighting sequences similar to Heavy Rain where Quick time events have to be completed lest Bigby take's a pounding that can have an effect on later events. Decisions you make also feel like they have more impact on the narrative than TellTale's other titles as it does a better job of masking the transparency of keeping you to the critical path of the story. Having a strong central objective and antagonist also makes each episode feel more cohesive than the Walking Dead.  Voice acting is top notch as every snarky remark and desperate confession carries appropriate weight. Facial animations are much stronger than the Walking Dead with less rogue eyebrow movements and a stronger emphasis on subtlety. The contrast between the idealized “happily ever after” fables and the miserable lives they're now living as supernatural beings with real world problems creates a truly engaging story. There's something special about seeing characters like Beauty and the Beast having marital problems after a few hundred years and needing help to pay rent to maintain any grasp on the lives they once had. While fables are generally told as children's stories they tend to be inherently dark and primal, the wolf among us isn't afraid to push further into the grit of old fables as adult themes, language and violence are common place.  Dialogue options are pretty satisfactory, there were only a few times I wasn't able to respond in a manner I felt would've been appropriate and piecing together evidence in a crime scene rewards the player by making relevant connections in dialogue afterward. Each episode is generally around 2 hours in length and worth the price of admission.  The Wolf Among Us offers a much stronger interactive experience than the first season of the Walking Dead with a captivating story, engrossing characters and a much needed fix on pacing. Bigby's investigation has plenty of twists and turns to keep players engaged in the on-goings of Fabletown with an original premise and a morally gray protagonist that allows every interaction regardless of how violent or generous to feel natural. While it allows you tackle objectives in different ways from time to time, the story remains pretty linear without any true divergences occurring. The overall outcomes are going to be similar regardless of what path you choose. Still, changing the details, and Fabletown's perception of Bigby has it's own reward. Anyone who's looking for a great story with action, humor, compassion, a talking pig and mystery should give the Wolf Among Us a try.  Don't feel like reading all of this?

My first real experience with any of their recent games was last summer, when I played and enjoyed the first seasdon of their vision on The Walking Dead. For the many gamers who've played either of these titles, the format of The Wolf Among Us will come as no surprise: it's an episodic adventure game based on a comics book-series. But the setting is rather different: in The Walking Dead people, be it good or bad ones, are set agaist the onslaught of a catastrophical zombie-apocalypse, which makes the player sympathize a lot (in my case anyway) with one or more of the people. The Wolf Among Us is based on the Fables comic books, a modern-day twist on several figures out of children's stories or legends who were driven from their homelands and turned to live in New York, helped by some magic called \"glamours\" that makes them appear in a human form.  This setting may look like less \"dangerous\" at the first sight, but that's actually far from the truth. What starts out as a mature version of a story using some well-known fable characters (The Bid Bad Wolf aka The Sheriff is the you one play with), rather quickly turns into a grim, gritty adventure where nothing is what it seems and dangers looms large around every corner. Fabletown turns out not to be the safe-heaven everybody hopes for, but a harsh place in the middle of a rather coldish city dominated by the impersonal lights of neon-advertisements. Just like in The Walking Dead, actual gameplay is restricted to watching cutscenes (all of them very compellingly done) and interacting with other fables and objects. There is hardly any inventory to speak of and no puzzles: the main thing to do is to react to what is being said or happens. For this several options are given, and most of the time you have to choose your reaction within a limited timespan. This is so meticiouly done, that some decisions can be taken at leisure, while others need to be done in a split-second (just like in real life, probably).  Gameplay-wise, the one real difference compared to other Telltale-games lies in the amount of quick action-scenes. In these, players have to react quickly by pushing an indicated button on the gamepad (which I do recommend highly for this type of games). There are quite of lot of these \"events\"', maybe too many to some's likings, but for me they felt perfectly integrated. This is an action-filled world after-all, where violence seems to be omnipresent. As such, this game is definitely not for children: the violence can be very brutal and up-close.  As an example of how an original story can be interactively told in a game, The Wolf Among Us succeeds magnificently. I did not feel the same amount of emotional interaction as in The Walking Dead, but the sheer tension and the detective-like feeling more than made up for that. This is another triumph for one of the best game developers currently active.  Gameplay: 27/30 Graphics: 17/20 (Telltale's engine is very well suited to the film noir-feeling this game has) Sound: 10/10 (the sound-effects and especially the music are top-notch and help so much to give the right atmosphere) Technical/stability: 10/10 (smooth and stable to perfection) Replayability: 5/10 (when paying good attention, there is no need for a second play-through, but that's perfectly normal) Steam integration: 9/10 (no trading cards but in true Telltale-tradition a bunch of achievements that unlock as you progress, making it an easy-to-get 100% game) Personal appreciation: 9/10  Overall score: 87/100. Wonderful game!","hours":11.7}

It's been a very long time since a game could make me physically say \"oh sh*t\" out loud... but let me tell you why:  Emotions. The Wolf Among Us is very good at invoking your emotions, but I'm not just talking about making you feel happy or sad... I'm talking about emotions and responses that a game rarely makes you feel, like disgust, shock, awe, and those awesome moments that make you go \"wow\" and \"f*ck yeah!\". From this, I'd like to state that the quality of the story is entirely superb and was very captivating. I was invested, and was always left wanting more after each twist and major plot point.  You play as Bigby Wolf, the big bad wolf himself! After uncovering a murder in Fabletown, you must discover clues, follow leads, question suspects, and try to fit all the pieces together... but all is not as it seems. This is very much a detective-thriller type of game, but has such a well written, engaging, and mature story that it at times feels like a film. Don't let the \"Point & Click\" genre thow you off because it's just simply breathtaking.  I went in to The Wolf Among Us blind, only basing my purchase on previous experiences with Telltale's \"The Walking Dead\". I can tell you now that I was delighted to discover a fresh and mature story to go along with outstanding voice acting. This game is all about the choices you make, and from the wide variety of emotional and moral options you're given, the voice acting only compliments it.  Although it may be short, it is definitely worth it, and playing as the big bad wolf himself is very, very fun (they weren't lying when they said this game was a \"gritty, violent and mature thriller\").   My advice is to go in to the game blind and just let it amaze you, like it amazed me. 10/10","hours":9.7}

I have been thinking about purchasing this game for a while now, being unsure if I would like it due to the fact that I disliked \"The Walking Dead\" games. Eventually, I made up my mind and purchased this game over the weekend and I do NOT regret purchasing it at all. Not played a GREAT game in years... Any of \"The Walking Dead Game\" fans out there will love this game since it follows the same style and it is made by the same developers I believe.  The Story was extremely interesting along with engaging, leaving you wanting more at the end of each episode due to the excellent Cliffhangers. It is a story that makes you think, even when you turn off the game and go on another game you are left thinking about it, because it is one of those games that has such an impacting and interesting story. All of the Characters were unique in their own way, there were those who you liked and there were those who you absolutely hated. Another thing I loved about this game was the amount of choices you got. If you disliked someone you could chose to act like a massive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to them or beat the living crap out of them which is always satisfying. Unlike \"The Walking Dead\" where you aren't really fearing anyone, \"The Wolf Among Us\" has it so pretty much nearly EVERYONE fears you which I loved.  As for how the game looks, the game looks very unique and is rather cartoony/sketchy which I enjoyed very much, it gave the game a very unique look to it along with the type of colours that were used within it. The game runs very smoothly as well and I did not have any problems with it on my Computer.  As for replay value, I did go back and replay some Episodes in order to get 100% Achievements and I feel like playing through the game again but this time, acting like a jerk or choosing different routes, choosing who to beat up and who to trust etc.  The only thing I disliked about this game was that it was pretty short. There are FIVE episodes and all of them are roughly 1 Hour 30 Minutes long so I managed to complete it in roughly 6-7 hours with 100% Achievements. Hopefully if there is a Season 2 then there will be more to come (I do believe a Season 2 is being made).

{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.699591998448127,"review":"Review finished. Scroll down to see individual episode thoughts and a final conclusion.  After Telltale’s breakout success with The Walking Dead, my expectations for whatever they chose to do next were understandably extremely high. Yet in the span of only the first episode, The Wolf Among Us has completely met and surpassed them leaving me stunned and impressed, feverishly awaiting the next installment (of which five are planned).  Based on the graphic novel series Fables, The Wolf Among Us is set in a world populated by fairy tale creatures, from Snow White to Red Riding Hood and others I won’t spoil for you. Don’t think for a second that this in any way makes for a childish or overtly fantastical narrative; TWAU is a shockingly gritty, mature, and gripping piece of fiction, held together by exceptional writing and voice work. Also, fear not if you haven’t read the source material (as I haven’t); Telltale did an excellent job of establishing the rich world and lore, and you don’t need any prior knowledge to get a lot out of it.  No character falls flat, and the performances that bring them to life are simply remarkable. Not least of them is our lead, Bigsby Wolf (you can probably guess his origin), that shows one of the key areas Telltale has improved upon from previous games. The Walking Dead was Telltale’s first real attempt at providing player choice to shape the narrative, but often it didn’t feel that way, largely relegating you to an onlooker “picking the right answer” than an active participant in what was happening.   TWAU changes that by letting you be the character you want to be. You can be the benevolent sheriff or a complete jerk, and it never felt as if I was being pushed toward either path, letting the story unfolded organically as I shaped Wolf to the person I wanted him to be, which makes the thought of what could unfold all the more exciting.  Telltale has again gone with a stylized, cel-shaded graphics style which comes even closer to a moving comic than TWD, and the result is stunning. With excellent use of shadows and framing, this is a gorgeous homage to classic film noir (which proves a perfect match for the dark, mystery ridden narrative). The controls are largely unchanged from TWD but have been tightened up considerably and the bugs and glitches that plagued previous games all but eradicated, making this the developer’s most technically sound production yet.  The Wolf Among Us is something you absolutely need to play. The first episode is an outstanding display of just what Telltale is capable in terms of storytelling, and if future episodes follow suit this could easily be in the running for my game of the year. The only reason I would recommend waiting is because the wait for more is going to prove unbearable. In the end all I can say is they’ve left me hungry...hungry like the wolf.  Episode 2 Update It's difficult to say much about EP2 without spoiling both it and the previous episode, so I will simply say it takes the story in even darker and more controversial areas than before. Telltale has further confirmed my original impression from EP1 that they have a bold vision for where they are taking the season, with numerous shocking and unrestrained moments fleshing out the characters and leaving me breathless in anticipation of EP3. I can only hope it doesn't take another four months to get here.  Episode 3 Update Where the first two episodes were used to introduce us to the characters, build the world, and set the plot rolling, EP3 acts as something of a midway point both literally and figuratively. There are few if any reveals or twists on the level of prior episodes, but with how invested I am with the characters and story at this point it didn't matter that I wasn't stunned when the credits began. Each moment to moment, no matter how mundane, held my rapt attention as I eagerly ate up every line of dialog and the innumerable subtleties found in character faces and the environments that bring such depth to the narrative. While it's too early to say with certainty, if the level of quality with the final two episodes continues to increase as rapidly as it has thus far, this may very well be my game of 2014.  Episode 4 Update At this point I'm so tightly wound up in what is easily Telltale's biggest masterpiece to date, that it's difficult for me to say anything more about TWAU without sounding like the the rabid fanboy I've become. As the season nears its end and all the lose threads begin to come together, the scope of Telltale's ambition and their ever expanding skill at directing that vision into an astounding experience is showing itself like never before. Even if the final episode falls completely flat, it won't change the fact that TWAU is easily one of the most amazing games to be released this year, and something that you shouldn't be ignoring. I'm going to be sad when it's over, but that doesn't diminish my irrepressible excitement to see how it ends.  Episode 5 Update And Conclusion Well, it's finally come to this. After months of pushed back release dates, missed timelines, and what seemed like endless waiting, The Wolf Among Us has finally seen it's last episode and cemented itself as not only the most ambitious and fully realized experience Telltale has ever made, but one of the most brilliant games of the year! EP5 incarnates everything that has been built up during past episodes, with a captivating conclusion that provides a fitting end to all that came before, while leaving room for the series to go in any number of directions with future installments.  As a whole, The Wolf Among Us is an enthralling breakthrough for Telltale and videogame storytelling as a whole. The pacing is sublime, the plot thrilling and riddled with intrigue, and the characters among the most well written and voiced I have yet to see in a game. It's shockingly brilliant in every regard and I am truly saddened that it has come to an end, for the sole reason that the wait for season 2 will feel like an eternity.  Telltale has succeeded without doubt in creating a fairy tale for a modern age, one that pulls no punches and surprises with each passing moment with the lines they are willing to cross to tell the story they want, and the means they have at their disposal to do so. It's dark, violent, ugly, occasionally appalling, but more than anything an absolutely astounding achievement that should not be overlooked.

I recently looked through my library and was attempting to categorize things - I didn't get very far! I realized that this was a game that I'd fully completed - but never got around to reviewing. Time to rectify that!  Apply the usual Telltale Format  The Wolf Among Us is an episodic game from Telltale; and follows their fairly tried and tested format of light point and click with QTE combat. I find the gameplay itself a little clunky and limiting and certainly not the strength of the game. The strength here is definitely the storytelling which I found extremely well written and engaging.   It is a dark retelling of some familiar fairy tales, where some memorable childhood characters are trapped in a dreary half-life, living under strict rules to protect the magical, terrified of being sent to \"the farm\". The Big Bad Wolf (Bigby) is the sheriff, investigating some brutal murders and unconvering piece by piece a conspiracy at the heart of the community. You can play Bigby as a cold-hearted cruel taskmaster, or a tortured good guy trying to atone.... or something in between. A realistic hybrid, a character with depth.  It's a crime-mystery storyline that pulls you in and drags you along at a good pace. Throw in a smidge of romance, a dollop of friendship and an awful lot of anger simmering beneath the surface and you've got a good drama brewing. It manages to be quite dark and emotional in places, whilst making me laugh in others. In short, it's a bloody good story.  Pros: ☑ ☑ ☑ Gripping writing and unique storyline. Believeable characters and good voice acting. Dark aesthetic. Choice of playstyles through dialogue.  Cons: ☒ ☒ ☒ Telltale's engine is dated and clunky. The only action comes from QTE events. The choices offer different dialogues, but ultimately aren't always meaningful. A fairly short game, around 8 hours should complete it.  This is my second favourite Telltale game, the first being The Walking Dead (Season One), so I'd definitely recommend it to those looking for an engaging and unique story.  P.S. I am starting to gather my reviews up through the curator system. If you'd like to read more of my reviews in the future and see what sort of games an old lady like me recommends, I'd appreciate it if you follow my curator page! ♥ ♥ ♥","hours":8}

Even without having read the original comics, I fell in love with the world and characters of the Wolf Among Us and found myself eager to play through the story more than once. Lots of decisions, genuinely surprising twists, suspense, memorable characters and moments... There's really nothing I can critique about this game. I also really enjoyed the voice acting! This will be the game I recommend to people who want to try Telltale or \"choice-and-consequence\" branching narratives. It is very adult and \"dark\" compared to their other franchises--think grim detective noir that doesn't shy away from some ugly crimes. Hopefully there will be a continuation someday!","hours":11.5}

{"funny_percent":0.15384615384615385,"helpful_percent":0.6416470355997338,"review":"First of all, I have to say that this is the one and only game that should win the following Steam Award:  \"BEST USE OF A FARM ANIMAL\"  Review on:   The Wolf Among Us is a Telltale adventure game based on Fables, a series of comic books that create a universe where characters of traditional \"fables\", hence the name, live \"among us\" (hence the other name).  The universe itself is not as childish as those tales, though, and that's something Telltale wants you to know from the very beginning. Fortunately, it falls not within the adulthood of God of War 2 and 3 but instead, closer to his older brother The Walking Dead.  Even if I consider, plot and structurewise, The Walking Dead to be a superior game, with The Wolf Among Us Telltale delivered another great gem which, while similar in many aspects to TWD, still manages to have strengths of his own.  The argument itself is Sherlock Holmes-esque, toned down to match the Fables universe, which I think is one of its biggest virtues. I was amazed by the way the game introduces and develops a bunch of characters taken out of fairy tales and accomplishes to keep a balance between the divergence and characterization of those characters with respect to their analogues in the traditional fables. Those characters are now living in the slums of New York city, and have been beaten by life itself. They are not shown as they truly are to us muggles, as that would lead to conflict. They are people with life and social problems, allowing us to easily empathize with them.  Gameplaywise, do not expect any more than a... Well, than a Telltale game. Which mainly consists in dialogue choosing and some quicktime events. I did appreciate that they polished the movearound moments of The Walking Dead (Lee having to cross the farm, quite a few minutes to get from point A to point B), but that's all there is to it. Same mechanics, same graphic engine...  BUT, you can surely expect a game that makes you think . And I'm not talking about the plot.  Which is a rather good thing, and I can't but recommend this game to you all.  (Various edits to format)","hours":15.1}

Just when I thought Telltale Games couldn't possibly surpass last year's The Walking Dead here comes The Wolf Among Us which is not only beautifully made (like a comic book in motion), but also well told and orchestrated, intriguing and exciting. This first episode has already won me over. I wonder how they're actually going to 1-up it. It seems almost impossible. Bravo Telltale Games, keep 'em coming!

{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.9013538101941385,"review":"(I am not familiar with the Fables comics source material, however no such familiarity is at all required to enjoy the game)   The 98% positive user reviews are probably good enough already, but just in case:   If you liked The Walking Dead, you'll probably like this.  If you like the X-Men character Wolverine, you'll probably like the main character, as they have many similarities.  If you like the idea of classic fairy tales being \"reimagined\" in a dark metropolitan setting, you'll probably like this.  The art style is great. I don't think the screenshots and trailers fully do it justice. Although the color inversion shadowing looks a very strange at times.   If you can't stand (fairly extreme) violence and/or swearing, you might want to pass on it. Though if you tolerated The Walking Dead on this point, you'll be fine.   A few other considerations:  The choice making in this game seems even less consequential than in The Walking Dead. This doesn't particularly bother me, but if you're expecting a branching story line, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.  I think there were more QTEs (Quick Time Events) than in The Walking Dead. This doesn't bother much either. I see it as a way to make the game feel more interactive and keep the user engaged and paying attention. Works well enough for me. I'm not expecting a deep gameplay challenge with a title like this.  Basically every main character is flawed somehow. Defiling your memory of beloved story book characters is part of the point here. You might not end up truly liking any of the characters. On the other hand, you might get a validatory kick out of seeing their utopias broken.","hours":10.5}

{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.8776075732986293,"review":"The Wolf Among Us is a story focused quick time event / point and click game, and is by far the best game i've played from Telltale until now.  Story / Setting  This is clearly the best thing with that game, it's probably the most original setting I've seen in a game ever. Without spoiling, it's some kind of mix between Harry Potter, fairy tails, and a film noir.  I found the story amazing, and I'm glad I bought the game late enough to play all episodes in a row at once ! (I finished the game in barely 3 days).   Gameplay  The gameplay is the exact same as the other Telltale games I had played (TWD S1&2). It just worked a bit better here, since this game is more based on investigation than TWD, and it really fits with the point and click aspect. The combats, dialogues, and investigation are still great, but once again, the choices you have to make don't have a real inpact on the story... whatever you choose, the main story elements will stay the same.  Performance  Runs ok on my 4 yo laptop, even on high settings.   Style / Graphics  Once again, it's the exact same thing as what I was used before with the developer. I love it, it looks like an interactive comic or something.   Really one of the best single player game I've played, and the best narrative one for sure. I just hope Telltale starts focusing more on the player choices / story evolution, and does some more original games like it, and less series / video game adaptations.","hours":10.9}

{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.7343632462658229,"review":"This is the first game by Telltale that I've played, and I was generally pretty impressed. First of all, the setting and characters are really well developed. It takes characters from many popular fairy tales and various fables, and it puts them in a gritty noir setting. Former princes and princesses now have to make ends meet by working crappy jobs and always being behind on their rent, whilst non-human characters are forced to blend in with the crowd by needing to apply an expensive magical potion on themselves regularly, and things of that nature.   The main plot revolves around a series of murders that we have to solve whilst taking the role of Bigby Wolf (aka Big Bad Wolf), who has been appointed as the Sheriff of Fabletown, a part of NYC where fairy tale characters live. The plot is gripping, with lots of tense moments, plot twists, as well as choice and consequence.  Regarding choices, after I completed the game, I went online to look up how impactful the choices are. Unfortunately most choices don't bear big consequences and for the most part only change a few lines of dialogue or alter the cutscene slightly, but there are a few big decisions peppered around in each of the 5 episodes that comprise this game. So in essence, it's more like an interactive novel with a linear story and only a few differences in the plot based on the choices. Fates of most characters will remain the same regardless of what you choose really.  The action scenes usually consist of quick time events where you have to punch, dodge, or perform some sort of quick action. If you really despise QTEs, the game might not be for you, although most QTEs aren't so bad and can be quite forgiving. I missed a few QTE prompts during cutscenes and still managed not to get any game overs.  The game has an excellent presentation. Beautiful art style, lovely voice acting, nice music, and well-crafted cutscenes and dialogue. Overall, highly enjoyable. I'd recommend it.","hours":8.3}
