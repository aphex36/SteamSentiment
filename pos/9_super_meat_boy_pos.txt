The soundtrack, the retro video games, the playable characters from other games, and I especially love the idea of the Dark World which clones all the main levels but made harder! If you are planning to buy this game, I suggest picking up the soundtrack too. What's an indie game without a zany soundtrack?  But let me tell you this one other thing: Practice makes perfect.

{"review":"Games becoming easier over the years is an interesting discussion. Were games too hard? Were they legitimatly hard on the nes? Snes? But difficult games are not gone completely. Games like dark souls and blood bourne show people still enjoy testing their limits. If those games names make you shutter at the thought of playing them due to the difficulty then this isn't a game for you. But to me? I love this game. It's a challanging platformer and yet...I almost never felt frustrated. But to start off, here we go.  Graphics 10/10-They're very pleasing to look at. Very minimalistic and not taxing on your hardware. I enjoy the little touches like blood trails on where you walk or climb. Don't expect ground breaking, but I don't think that was the intent.  Sound 10/10- Sound tracks are good. And never really repetitive. And the death sounds are gross in the best way possible.  controls 10/10-Perfect. Period. And it needs to be. If the controls were even a little bit off, it would be unplayable due to the pin point accuracy you need to get through the game. Ironicly the controls are so perfect you will need to get used to them. There is NO delay and that may throw you off for a little bit. But I never felt like the controls messed me up.  Gameplay 9/10-I love it. But it's really hard. I cannot say this enough. You need so much practice and such great reflexes, that you may not be able to beat the game. My point is that this game isn't for everyone. But this game does make it less frustrating by respawning you when you die at once. And the levels are not long either meaning you can get back to where you died quickly. Unlimited lives as well. My only problem is the hidden levels that have lives. It seems counter intuitive to the idea of the game and doesn't seem like a good idea.But it's so rewarding when you beat a level, it just feels unmatched.   replay 10/10- Yes, this will last you a while. unlockable characters with their own abilities,hidden levels and a harder dark world to complete...you get the bang for your buck.  overall 10/10-This isn't for everyone. But with it's perfect controls, great level design, and dark sense of humor, I always had fun even when I died, a lot.  ","hours":21.8,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":1}

{"review":"This has to be the most challenging platform game I’ve ever played; Super Meat Boy (SMB) rises steadily in difficulty from easy to ridiculously hard core crazy. After passing the first boss I had to stop simply because my tired old bones and aching hands were almost suffering from RSI . That said; this is a beautifully executed game that will keep the most dedicated of platformer fans wanting more.   SMB has an endearing style of its own (despite the copious trails and splashes of blood with precisely designed levels that fit the theme of the game perfectly, plus it takes me back to the days when skill was the most important attribute for getting through a level. You'll need lots of that if you are to get to the end of this game, especially unscathed. I really don't know how anyone could get through a complete area without dying at least once. You'd need to be superhuman, or one of the best platformers in the world to beat these levels.    You'll often be surprised or even relieved at how short some of the levels are (no more than about 30 seconds); that said, with a content of over 300 maps, bonus stages and hidden warp zones that contain challenging extra-maps, dark worlds (one for each stage, e.g. Salt Factory Dark World, Hell Dark World etc) and, not forgetting the unlock-able characters which can be gained by collecting bandages that are placed in hard to get locations on several levels or finishing warp zones - try getting through one of the main stages or the hidden dark worlds without dying to gain achievements - only 0.6% to 1% of the Meat boy community are getting these achievements because they are ultra hard to achieve. Anyway, with all of these extra's plus using the editor, (which you'll find in your library under tools), you have the potential to create unlimited levels, that are only limited by your imagination, need for more levels and stamina, it's hard to get bored of this game. On top of that you're able to implement Maps made by the community.  If you don't already own SMB; now that its over 3 years old, you'll easily pick it up for a bargain price, especially in the many Steam sales that we get these days.   I highly recommend this game, despite me not achieving much in the way of completing most of the levels yet , (I've spent over 20 hours playing this game already and I'm still hungry for more) nor getting many of the in game achievements (couldn't be bothered collecting the bandages, lol). I certainly intend returning to the game when my hands have recovered from the deviously executed level designs.   If you've not played this game get it as soon as you can; maybe check out the demo (unfortunately Steam don't offer a demo download), or play the browser based flash game: http://www.kongregate.com/games/edmund/meat-boy to get a feel for the game.  Highly recommended and a 9 out of 10 from me (it loses a point simply because its a little too hard for me.  Last words: It's one of the best platformers of the last decade in my opinion (apart from maybe Gish). ","hours":28.6,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.8705882352941177}

{"review":"One of the best and most well-designed platformers ever made. Don't let the rhetoric that Super Meat Boy is a notoriously hard game deter you. Yes, SMB does eventually get very difficult, but that is at the end of a very long, iterative road that starts off easy and gradually builds. At no point will this game beat you over the head mercilessly and make you feel hopeless. It wants you to succeed and get better, and that's where the great design comes in. Bite-sized levels, infinite lives, and you instantly respawn when you die. This is a game that respects your time, and I greatly appreciate that.  Super Meat Boy is also about freedom, always progressing and enjoying yourself. Get to a level that you swear you can't beat? Skip it and move on. You don't need to complete every level in a world to unlock the next one, and you can complete the levels in any order you choose with any character you choose. There are also hidden warp zones to explore, and a dark world to dip your toes in as well.  And once you've gone through some more levels, maybe done some hidden warp zones and took a breather, you go back to that one level that you were having trouble with and suddenly realize that it got easier. And it's not because you raised your stats or leveled up in the game, but because you naturally got better. It didn't take someone on a forum yelling at you to 'git gud' to do it. All it took was an incredibly fun and addictive game with super-tight controls and a metric ton of content.  That is why Super Meat Boy stands above the rest as one of the shining gems of indie gaming. It's just that good. Oh, and having an amazing soundtrack doesn't hurt either.","hours":90.3,"funny_percent":0.08695652173913043,"helpful_percent":0.9782608695652174}
