{"review":"Deadpool is an action beat'em up game based on the Marvel Comic book character. The game was developed by High Moon Studios and published by Activision. The title was released on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 in June 2013. Due to a licensing issue, the game was later taken off sale digitally in January 2014, before being re-released on Steam in July 2015. Deadpool will also be seeing a re-released version on the Ps4 and Xbox One in November of 2015.   The gameplay in Deadpool is a very basic hack and slash style. You have quick and heavy melee attacks, whilst also having a selection of guns to choose from as well. You are able to combine the quick attacks and heavy attacks together to make some interesting yet powerful combinations. Throughout the game you are also able to purchase upgrades and learn further combos allowing you to pull of some spectacular looking attacks in the latter stages of the game. As you pull of more and more complex combos, you are rewarded with more of the in game currency, allowing you again to purchase upgrades, new weapons and side arms, such as grenades and traps for instance. There is so much to actually upgrade in this game; and you may even find it hard to purchase the majority of the skills too; so it may be wise to plan out how you envisage you playing the game at the very start of your play through - whether it be melee based, or more focused on guns and ranged attacks.   There is a small element of platforming to be seen in Deadpool, but nothing that gets too annoying, yes the jumping puzzles are very prominent in some stages, but as you get further into the game, you will also learn a teleporting ability which makes small work of any platforming problems.   Graphically, Deadpool takes on the same sort of style as you would expect from the comic book series. Nothing majorly fancy, just your standard looking last generation title. The cut scenes look far worse than the actual gameplay which is something I am becoming increasingly aware of given the fact that they also run in a lower frame rate as well. All of the animations of everything in the game are stellar though, when pulling off the crazy combo attacks, it looks so fluid and I cannot fault the animation in Deadpool in anyway.   The plot in Deadpool is also very inline as what you would expect if you have any knowledge of the comic book series. Deadpool continuously breaks the fourth wall, referencing you, the player on a frequent basis, making comics on the game design and the developers. Having only read a couple of the Deadpool comic books, I still felt as if I had known this character for years, and even someone who has no knowledge of who Deadpool is, will surely appreciate the comical value on offer here. The lewd comments, the toilet humour and the staple one liners all make an appearance and had my chuckling along throughout my play through.   At no point throughout the game did I feel challenged though; I was playing on the normal difficulty and really felt a bit let down with the foes in front of me. Once you learn a few combos and upgraded a few bits of equipment, there is really no challenge at all in the fighting scenes as you plough through squads of enemy troops without any issues. I would strongly suggest that you play this game on the highest difficulty to get any sort of challenge out of the gameplay though.   All of the levels within Deadpool have a lot of items which you can pick up, such as ammo and collectable items and not to mention plentiful amounts of the in game currency to use on them precious upgrades. I found myself at times venturing off the main path just to collect more of this currency and this can sometimes lead to a few little Easter eggs to be found. That being said; there is only one way to complete a level, one entrance, and one exit; a completely linear experience - I didn't find this to be a bad thing; it just would have been nice to see a couple of other ways to complete a few of the stages.  I have played through Deadpool twice now, once when it first came out, and a second one recently. Each play through took me roughly 12 hours to complete; that's quite a long time for a linear single player game of this type, but with the lack of any multiplayer, there isn't any replay ability and no other reason to play through a second time unless you are going to ramp up the difficulty like I did on a second run through.   Whilst playing I had a couple of technical issues, none of them were game breaking problems, just little annoyances. The first one being that sometimes after interacting with an object, whether it be a lever or opening a chest, Deadpool would for some reason start moving in a direction on its own, and it takes a couple of key presses before it stops and you then have control over the character again. Secondly, there is a huge amount of invisible walls throughout most of the levels too; you can be trying to jump up a wall and suddenly you will hit a wall of nothing and will completely mess up your jumping puzzle just because the developer didn't want you to go down that path. Thirdly, the lack of any graphics options when in game is a real pain as well; you have to completely back out right to the main menu before you can make any changes - this is just annoying and shouldn't be something we see in common day PC releases. I will say though, I did play Deadpool on 4k resolution, with all the graphics setting on max and was able to get a steady 60 fps MOST of the time. I did notice a few drops sub 60, but these were few and far between and only on the highly graphically intensive scenes.   To sum up, I would simply recommend Deadpool, it's not a fantastic game, but it will certainly wet your appetite for more games of this style. The comical value alone for me made this a worthwhile experience. It is certainly not worth the full price tag of £29.99, no no no no. That is day light robbery right there, the lack of any real replay ability and 12 hour story mode is a real warning sign and you should only consider picking up Deadpool when it goes on sale for anything less than £15. I would also just put it out there; that I would pick it up sooner rather than later before another issue with licensing arises and Deadpool is removed from Steam again - this may only be relevant for game collectors though.  Tom's Score Card 1) Stay away 2) Not Recommended 3) Only recommended when on sale 4) Recommended 5) Highly recommended 6) This is a must play  If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

{"review":"Deadpool is an over-the-top action adventure game with lots of humor. Yes, it's not the most intelligent humor out there, but it certainly has a couple of hilarious moments. Too bad the gameplay is so generic.   First of all, let me start by saying that the game looks great and I really enjoyed the subtle animations of Deadpool. It looked natural so I was pleasantly surprised. Add to that the fantastic voice acting of Nolan North and you have a fun character to play with. The fact that Deadpool is aware that he's in a game makes the game that much more special.   But despite all that, the gameplay itself is disappointing to say the least. If you ever played an action adventure game before this, you know exactly what to expect. You'll be slashing and shooting enemies for 7-8 hours straight with one or two exceptions. I won't spoil these for you as they make the game a bit better, or more interesting.   Coins can be found all over the levels and slain enemies will drop coins as well. Collecting these allows you to upgrade Deadpool or any of his weapons. It's nothing major and most of us won't even notice the differences, except for the fact that enemies are killed faster.   The boss fights are uninteresting and the villains aren't even worth mentioning except for Mr. Sinister. On the other hand, the X-Men cameos are much cooler because you'll probably recognize more of those characters (like Rogue and Wolverine). Still, they're only in it for a few short moments so it's not that you'll be seeing them for tens of minutes. But it's still cool.  The controls could've been tweaked a little more. It generally works ok, but the teleport button is also used for evading attacks. Things can get kinda hectic and sometimes instead of evading you'll just teleport behind your enemies. Awkward.  There are also a few glitches. Opening treasure chests, for example, glitched A LOT for me. Deadpool would just stand over it and do nothing and no matter how many times I pressed the button the game just wouldn't register it properly. Again, nothing major, but it's still something that should've been fixed before release.  Ok, so let me sum things up again: if you're a comic book fan, or more specific, you love Deadpool, this is the game for you. If you love generic action adventures, this is for you. If you love humor and love to play a funny character, again, Deadpool is for you.  If you aren't interested in any of these things, well then, Deadpool's not for you. Just do yourself a favor and skip it.  [Rating: 75/100]","hours":7.8,"funny_percent":0.008849557522123894,"helpful_percent":0.8761061946902655}
{"review":"Deadpool Developer: High Moon Studios Publisher: Activision  Introduction ========== After a rather extended vacation, Deadpool is back on Steam. The Merc with a Mouth's own video game is just as you'd imagine: full of blood, weapons, and Deadpool's own unique fourth-wall breaking brand of humor. Oh yes, it's just as fun as you think. But not at full-price. While Deadpool's game is more fun than you can imagine, it's rather short, clocking in at just over 7 hours on my own playthrough - not enough for $39.99.  Gameplay ========== At its core Deadpool is a hack n' slash third person shooter with some platformer elements. You are able to control Deadpool as he wrecks all manner of baddies with his rather underwhelming, yet suitable-for-the-job arsenal of weapons. Deadpool has 3 melee weapons, 4 different types of firearms, and about 5 types of throwables. You can mix light and heavy attacks with your melee weapons to perform all manner of combos, while you can use your guns to take out distant enemies, or perform \"gunkata\" attacks mid-combo. You can make use of Deadpool's teleporter belt to dodge attacks and even travel short distances later in the game.  Each of Deadpools weapons can be upgraded, unlocking different special abilities and traits using Deadpool Points. These points are gained by defeating enemies, or found laying around in the world. The more enemies you thwomp, the higher your combo count goes. The higher your combo count, the more Deadpool Points you earn. Therefore it's in your best interests to defeat enemies as efficiently and as quickly as possible so you can upgrade your weapons and abilities sooner rather than later. Enemies also drop ammo, which, like Deadpool Points, can also be found laying around.  There is quite a bit of platforming in the game, and as such Deadpool is able to double jump and later teleport to ledges and platforms over short distances. He is also able to walljump off of buildings, walls, and other things in the environment. This can be used to traverse areas or as a way to get into a more advantageous position during combat.  Graphics ========== As far as games go, Deadpool doesn't look bad. It's technically last gen, but it looks nice enough. The best parts are the little details. For example, as Deadpool takes damage his suit gets messed up, revealing his cancer-ridden body. If left alone long enough, Deadpool regenerates health, and apparently his suit as well. It's actually pretty cool to sit and watch that happen.  There is slight variation in enemy designs, but not much. For the most part you will be facing hordes of clones, and there are about 8-10 types. You'll probably get sick of seeing them, but not of blowing them up. Every melee attack or gunshot results in blood going everywhere in very generous amounts.  Sound and Music ========== For an action game, the soundtrack's alright. It matches Deadpool's wit and jokes surprisingly well. But it's nothing to write home about. It does it's job, and nothing more. In fact a lot of it is reused quite a bit.  Sound effects are a different matter. The gunshots sound very satisfying, especially high rate-of-fire guns. Sword slashes, blood splashing around, bodies piling up...it all sounds so awesome.  Perhaps the best part of the game is the voice acting....the constant jokes and jabs at everything that Deadpool and his 2 inner voices make. Every single line of dialogue from Deadpool is hilarious. The game really stays true to the character.   Performance ========== The game runs pretty well, with very few instances of slowdown or lag. I did experience it a few times, but it was short lived. For the most part it ran perfectly and a smooth 60 FPS at nearly all times. I played with a Logitech F310 controller, and it worked very well by default, with no configuration needed. The controls were very smooth and intuitive.  Final Thoughts ========== Deadpool is a fun game for fans of the character, in fact it's a must-have for fans. For all others however, there are better offerings available that offer more playtime. Still, it's a fun game for a while, albeit a bit short. Still, it's friggin' Deadpool. What's not to like?

{"review":"Deadpool is a third-person hack'n'slash action game revolving around the mentally unstable mercenary and anti-hero from the Marvel Universe and was developed by California-based High Moon Studios, better known for their previous games such as Transformers: War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron.  STORY The story is fairly simple: Deadpool hangs out in front of his TV and gets a call from his agent with the offer to get his own video game, so after taking a brief look at the script, Deadpool, accompanied by the two voices in his head, rolls out to start kicking some butt, defeating the evil Mister Sinister (because every games has to have a bad guy) and saving humanity, the world, the universe and whatnot. Deadpool is aware of the fact that he is inside his own video game at all times, so a lot of the dialogues revolve around this fact and he will often speak to or about you (the player) directly, which makes for some hilarious conversations between him and other characters in the game, such as X-Men like Wolverine or Rogue.  HUMOR The basic story alone could hardly carry the game, so an essential part of what makes the game so much fun are the hilariously stupid dialogues and tons of WTF-moments. The humor in the game is often pretty immature but fits like a glove for a whacky character such as Deadpool and actually made me almost spill my drink more than once. It's entertainment on a relatively low level, but perfect for an hour or two when you just want to turn your brain off and have some fun.  VISUALS Obviously being a console port, the game doesn't offer many PC-specific graphics settings apart from brightness, fullscreen, resolution, VSync and graphics presets (low, medium, high, extra), but despite this fact the game still looks pretty good and runs smooth with only a few occasional FPS drops. Level and character design is also pretty decent for what it is.   GAMEPLAY The gameplay basically consist of fast-paced close combat and while you do have a couple ranged weapons such as pistols, shotguns or rifles, the focus definitely lies on your melee weapons. Unfortunately, there are only 3 of them: Swords, Sais and Hammers. Another unfortunate thing is that the combat as such feels rather weak and uninspired. While there generally is nothing wrong with fighting waves after waves of enemies, it gets quite repetative when you execute the same moves over and over again because there aren't any combos or special moves to bring in some variety. You do have a couple special attacks that can be unleashed by filling up your Momentum-Meter, but it takes quite a bit to fill it up and the attacks as such don't really feel powerful or devastating enough to really make a difference.  You can extensively upgrade all of your weapons and Deadpool directly via DP points (gained by collecting them in the levels or killing enemies), but most of the upgrades feel like they have very little or no effect on the combat or the damage you deal. A game like this could've really used some epic and devastating weapons or upgrades where you both see and feel what a huge damage they deal.   Between the fighting areas there are occasional stealth sequences (with the most hilarious sneaking character animation in a video game ever, btw) where you can take out enemies silently with some pretty gorey finishing moves. Furthermore, there are a couple minigames, puzzles and dream-like sequences in the game. None of them are really essential for the story or the game as such, but they give you a bit time to take a breath from the fast-paced action and some of them, such as a sidescrolling platformer minigame, add a nice bit of change to the gameplay.  PLAYTIME & REPLAYABILITY The story consists of 8 fairly lengthy levels and beating the game on Veteran difficulty took me roughly 8 hours, which I consider a decent enough playtime for a game like this. Apart from replaying the story for the LOL-factor, you can try your luck in one of the 8 Challenge maps to fight your way to the top of the online leaderboards. 2 more challenge maps are available through the Merc with a Map Pack DLC, but if you're not into wave-based challenge modes, you probably can save the money. Other than that, there's nothing else to do in the game.  CONCLUSION Deadpool is fun. Plain and stupid fun. If you expect an immersive and touching story, profound characters or challenging gameplay that will put your skills to the test, this game is definitely not for you. If you want a couple hours of brainless entertainment, look no further and get this game!","hours":7.8,"funny_percent":0.02,"helpful_percent":0.94}

{"review":"Recommending this one solely for Deadpool fans.  In terms of gameplay, nothing is horrid, but other games (such as Ninja Gaiden and Max Payne) have done it better, which leaves the game's humour as its only defining point.   Category A: If you're a fan of Deadpool (specifically the Deadpool comics from writer Daniel Way), you'll play this from start to finish with a massive grin, and I honestly have to commend it for being genuinely funny rather than today's video game norm of cramming a load of barely-funny-the-first-time-you-hear-them memes in.  Category B: If you're not a fan of Deadpool, you'll probably just find the humour annoying and get stuck-up on the ho-hum gameplay and level design.  Category A: Recommended. Category B: Not recommended. Delete where appropriate.  Another note: Even though Nolan North is the most overused entity to ever walk the earth, I have to give him credit for this one. Seems like he has more in his repertoire than generic white hero guys, as he fits Deadpool like a glove.

{"review":"I nearly didn't bother with this, but decided to purchase it as I used to love my pulp super heroes. :) The game started off very similar to Duke Nukem 3D with respect to using the bathroom, except this was really funny. The humor in the game is a refereshing change from most games that I play and the combat is pretty simple to pick up using a combination of a couple of keys. Using these see''s your Katana's flying like the wind, with Witcher like sword trails abounding.   Enemies do seem rather easy to despatch at first, but you'll soon be trying to dodge bullets to survive. Thankfully one of your attributes is a teleport sytem, which enables you to move around randomly. The upgrade system is straighforwards, collect the tokens throughout the game world, that are equivalent to cash. These can then be spent on upgrading your weapons and buying new ones. Skills are unloked on the way.  Graphically the game looks excellent and, more importantly, so far no glitches.   I'd certasinly recommend this to anyone into super heroe type games,It's a decent price in the US, CIS and UK, but the EU is paying way over the odds at 63% above the average price, wheras, unusually Australia is getting it 25% cheaper than most places.","hours":5.7,"funny_percent":0.02,"helpful_percent":0.78}

{"review":"Fun, yet drawn out  Deadpool is a fun and very humorous game developed by High Moon Studios and published by Activision. You play as Deadpool himself in a crazy 4th breaking colorful adventure.....But is that really all?   Gameplay  Gameplay has got a fair amount to do, and takes notes from God Of War, and the Arkham games in terms of how battles are done. Sometimes as you're playing, you may have small opportunities to try something interesting, such as the game changing it's system to be like a platformer, or topdown game like the first Zelda. During the game, you'll also have interesting quicktime events as well. The game tries to keep it interesting from time to time; however, you will find at times the game is drawning out a little long in the tooth with battles, example being, you run to a room, bad guys, and then you run a few more steps, more bad guys, and this can go on for quite awhile. On a brightnote, you are treated to some really funny moments and 4th Wall jokes to lighten the mood. You do have an opportunity to become better by earning DP points, and can earn more depending on your combos and how you perfom, but be ready to fight hard, because you will need lots of DP points to gain ground on your weapons as you go forward.  Graphics Graphics are fairly good for 2013, but do have a lack of polish to them. You can see in the cutscenes, they're rendered rather poorly, and during gameplay, a lot of lacking 2D shading is around. It's not terrible looking, but I can see this game aging poorly down the line.   Sound  Taking Deadpool himself, voiced by Nolan North (Uncharted's Nathan Drake), Nolan does an actually very good performance of Deadpool, complimenting the environment, and surroundings. He is the show, and he lives it up. This is one of the strongest points for the game, as without a well voiced Deadpool, there is no game to even enjoy. Props to High Moon for this cast choice. As for the rest of the sounds, they're ok at best. They take a bunch of Casino sounds, and bullet sounds and you hear a lot of that. The X-Men voice actors are just OK as well, which I might understand considering they're not the reason you play, but it would of been nice if the voice actors added a little life to them.  Controls. On and off here. Most of the time they work, and sometimes, when opening a Chest or pressing the command it wants you to press, Deadpool will move into position and nothing will happen. Sometimes, I found myself pressing the command 3 or 4 times until the game moved forward with the action.   Overall  Deadpool is not a terrible game, but it lacks a lot more than it should have. The environments are mostly bland, and at times you'll find yourself very bored with moving forward. I wouldn't recommend this at full price, and I barely recommend it at all. Nolan North gives a great performance, but really carries a game that isn't helping at all. The colors are dull, the gameplay is standard, and the battles up until the final boss fight are all just disapointing and tiring. If you're going to play it, play it on a rainy day.  6.5/10","hours":8.5,"funny_percent":0.10714285714285714,"helpful_percent":0.8214285714285714}

{"review":"ANCRON's Deadpool's review of Deadpool the game.  3rd person, hack and slash, action game. It's about \"antihero\" called Deadpool (Wade Winston Wilson), disfigured and mentally unstable mercenary with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor. He is known as the \"Merc with a Mouth\" because of his talkative nature and tendency to break the fourth wall, which is used by writers to humorous effect. This game is not to be taken seriously at any point. Some humor may be rude, offensive and plain bootlegged but it's the nature of Wade (Deadpool), so don't question it and just go with the flow.  [Deadpool]: I think someone's at the door Andrew. [ANCRON]: Oh, really? Can you keep an eye on this? [Deadpool]: Yeah, sure. [ANCRON]: Thanks man, be right back. [Deadpool]: Hmm what we have here, review of my game... hmmm..let's see.  [Deadpool's Inner voice]: Story is about me, Deadpool, of course.. well who else, and some of his \"sidekicks\", like boring Wolverine, and my BABES Psylocke, Rogue and other low tier heroes. I don't even know why we keep Wolverine, he's short and too serious all the time, real mood killer.. and girls.. well girls have..  [Inner voice 1]: HOLY TITTS!! [Deadpool]: Not you again..  [Inner voice 2]: Hey don't forget me! [Inner voice 1]: So we gonna meet Rogue today? [Deadpool]: Would be nice. [Inner voice 2]: Rogue.... [Deadpool]: Wonder if she likes pancakes. [Inner voice 1]: She will love our pancakes! [Inner voice 2]: Yeah. [Deadpool]: Well, anyway. Back to my review.  [Deadpool's Inner voice]: I saw Rogue in my dream today, I wonder what she does this evening, will have to call her.  [Inner voice 2]: Yeah would be nice. [Inner voice 1]: I love Rogue! [Inner voice 2]: Yeah, she's really soft.  [Deadpool's Inner voice]: Let me see... yeah we don't need all that.  Gameplay is your basic hack and slash experience, with ranged or melee weapons. You receive experience from defeated enemies as well as randomly scattered XP orbs, that you can find throughout the levels and use to improve, unlock and learn new skills, weapons, etc. Deadpool can use guns, grenades, sais, knives, hammers, katanas and other weapons. You have your basic attacks, special moves and finishers for every weapon type. Attacks with smaller weapons tend to be more faster and do less damage compared to ones with katanas and hammers, and depending on enemy some may be more effective than others.  [Deadpool]: Yeah, yeah.. I punch stuff, stuff falls out and I become stronger and get the BABES! [Inner voice 1]: TITTS!! [Inner voice 2]: Mmm so soft..  There's a lot of nasty, rude and simply stupid humor throughout the game. [content deleted] [Deadpool]: He really like that \"throughout\" word. [Inner voice 1]: Yeah, haha. [Inner voice 2]: But he's our friend! [Deadpool]: Yeah, but it's my game! Enough of this, just buy it, it's really fun! [Inner voice 1]: Yeah we promise! [Inner voice 2]: For realz! [Deadpool]: He's coming back! Act natural. [Inner voice 1]: Oh shh.. [Inner voice 2]: Hide!!  [ANCRON]: Who were you talking to? [Deadpool]: Umm, noone so who was it? [Inner voice 1]: He doesn't have a clue what we did! [Inner voice 2]: Shhhhh.. he'll hear you. [ANCRON]: Well, Psylocke came by. She's free this evening and accepted my invitation to cinema. [Deadpool]: WOW! Really?! Cool, second base and all haha! Is Rogue coming too? [ANCRON]: Thanks. Well I could ask her, you wanted to come with us? [Inner voice 2]: I bet he would, he's been jumping out of his pants for Rogue lately. [Inner voice 1]: Haha, his pants, good one. [Deadpool]: Hey I don't wear pants! [Inner voice 1]: Oh right. Wait what!? [ANCRON]: What pants? What are you talking about? [Deadpool]: Well pants that I don't wear because I'm in bodysuit, so why would I need pants. So about that call? [ANCRON]: Oh, yeah I will as soon as I finish my review.  [Deadpool walks away]  [ANCRON]: What the hell happened to my revie... DEADPOOOOOOL!! [Inner voice 1]: Haha, he's mad. [Inner voice 2]: Yeah.  [Deadpool]: Don't question it, just buy the damn game. I worked my butt off on it.   /=/ Excuse me and Deadpool for any vulgar or inappropriate content in this review /=/  [Deadpool]: Not really... [ANCRON]: Deadpool be nice. [Deadpool]: Alright. I'm sorry. ;8) [Deadpool whispers]: Not really.  P.S.

{"review":"Deadpool is a fun game, but obviously it's more fun to those familiar with the character. And of course, you have to like him too.  As for the game, melee is fun, guns are cool, bombs are effective and as the game progresses it all blends into a fun milkshake of mechanics. You'll be stabbing, shooting and setting out bear traps for the bigger enemies. There's some platforming involved and it's not super great, but it's not horribly bad either.  Little side activities add to the fun, though there are not many. Some special appearances from some of your favorite X-Men and the ever interesting self aware perspective where Deadpool know he's in a game.  On the whole, a fun little game, though not very long. Short and sweet. I do plan to play it again on hard mode. Marvel fans especially, pick it up.

{"review":"Deadpool broke the 4th wall in the comics, but now it's time to break it in his own video game.  Deadpool is a game based on the Marvel anti hero of the same name. Deadpool is now in his own video game and he has to kill Mr. Sinister and he meets a few familiar faces along the way.  Deadpool is hack and slash game with guns. Not to mention the game breaks the 4th wall constantly and the game flow changes from a typical hack and slash into a platforming game and then into a top down 8 bit game. The gameplay is this games biggest weakness as it get's boring incredibly fast as nothing is really changed up during the fighting segments. Even the boss fights are the same as the regular enemies. The bosses only have a bigger health bar and that's pretty much it.  Deadpool's biggest strength is the amazing script and Nolan North's voice work as Deadpool. This game had me smiling and laughing the entire time and I loved every minute of it (I'm a big Deadpool fan btw). Deadpool fans will absolutely love the comedy in this game.  The cameos from different X-men are also awesome. Seeing faces like Wolverine and Rouge and Psylocke is just awesome and the comedy Deadpool spews about them is also incredibly awesome if you know the backstory and if you don't you get the option to hear about them in a recap narrated by Deadpool himself.  The game took me 5 hours to finish and apart from the one playthrough there is not much replay value as nothing really changes up. Not to mention there's no new game plus so you can't take the upgrades you got during the first time playing and import them in the second playthrough.  There are challenge maps, but those get incredibly boring incredibly fast so unless you plan on getting a 100% I don't recommend playing them.  Deadpool is also quite easy for the most part. There are some hard parts, but nothing incredibly difficult you won't be able to finish.  The game ran incredibly well. I got a stable 60 FPS and max settings and never had trouble, so I doubt people will run into trouble.  For the current price, I really can't recommend buying Deadpool as much as I love the character. The game while is fun and incredibly funny, it's way too short for 30 euros. If you can get it for a discount, I highly suggest giving it a chance. And if you love Deadpool this is a must own for the comedy itself. I enjoyed the game a lot and I would recommend buying it at a discount.  Final Rating: 7.5/10 - Worth Buying on a discount   If you liked this review please give it a thumbs up and if you disliked, post in the comments what you disliked about the review.

I must say that I like Deadpool (the character) a lot, I was not really interested before, but when I actually launched it I was blown away by how great it is.  The story is cool, and Deadpool always got some funny comment around the corner, however many of the comments is used over again, but it doesn't really matter because it's still fun. While playing I am always looking forward to the next cuts-cene or scinematic, because Deadpool always got some crazy twisted look on the reality, you get to see things as he sees them, and that makes this game so awesome. It's not too long but it's pretty much a \"standard\" completion time.

{"review":"Deadpool is a hack and slash game where you play Deadpool out of the Marvel comics. Deadpool is not your ordinary super hero, he's far from that. He is neither a hero or a villan, he's more an insane mercenary with superpowers which is a fantastic combination. Unlike most games, or movies because he also has a movie since last year, Deadpool likes to break the 4th wall meaning he will talk to you and acknowlegde you as the one watching/playing. He also has a lot of inner conversations with himself which teaches you more about his personality.  The story is pretty simple you, as Deadpool obviously, want to star in your own game like all other famous superheros have their own game. In this game you chase someone to kill for a contract for the x-men but unfortunately for you someone else was first and you want revenge on the killer. Knowing Deadpool there will be jokes all around about everythings and even references to other games. I liked all of the jokes except for the budget jokes, they seemed forced to do every once in a while. What I liked about the budget jokes is the minigames that reference other games, that made up for it. In the story you'll encouter some of the x-men and you see, if you choose so, to get a cool comic like introduction to them if you didn't know them before. The ending was really well done, I expected another battle but the good joke certainly made up for it. After the game I wondered if Nolan North portrayed Deadpool better than Ryan Reynolds but after rewatching the movie again I realised both of these platforms have different standards. What I mean with that is that the game held back on a certain kind of jokes but the movie went full on \"I don't care\" modus which is the reason why I won't compare both of the actors. I feel that if they had the same freedom it would have been different.  The combat in this game is melee weapons like swords or hammers combined with guns and you can mix them and combo them to kill everything in sight. Each weapon, when upgraded a little, unlocks a special momentum combo which you recharge with hurting and killing enemies. In this game they really made the variety of weapons useful, mostly you have in games the broken weapons and the terrible ones which inflict nothing but in this game I felt like fully upgraded every weapon was equal in terms of usefulness and damage. In this game you can also teleport for a short distance and you can also use that to counter attacking enemies following up with a nice animation but I don't think it's necessary. It's been more a pain in the foot to me than something useful because countering forces you to stand still for a short while which makes you a shooting target for all other enemies. There's also a possiblity to stealth kill enemies rarely but every time you get offered such a kill you should take the chance because they are very nice and every weapon has it's unique kind of execution.   What I generally don't like is the difficulty spiking in this game, it's really inbalanced. First of all when you play the story the second time you get to keep all weapons and DP, points for killing enemies, from previous run which makes it generally easier but it didn't matter after all. There is easy, veteran and ultra-violent. To me easy and veteran was the same kind of experience to me, I didn't had any trouble beating both of those difficulties but ultra-violent is a whole different story. Once you stand in the wrong position for one second on this difficulty and you get 4 bullets in your chest and you are 'dead'. Dead in this game just means that you get placed at last checkpoints since Deadpool can't die at all theoretically. Adding to this you already have enemies who take 3 shotgun shots to the chest and still live, and those are just the grunts with armour. In veteran the same grunts just got two shot like the rest of them.  In the end a good recommendation for Marvel fans, comics fans, superhero movie fans and gamers who enjoy hack and slashes.","hours":18.8,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":1}
