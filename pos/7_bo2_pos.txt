LOS ANGELES WAS THE FLAGSHIP OF THEIR ABSURD MATERIALISM, SO I DESTROYED IT.\"  Alright, I'm absolutely blown away.  When I finished Black Ops 1 again I stated that it is last good Call of Duty, but let me change it. Everything after BO2 is trash. Yes, I did like Kevin Spacey in AW and yes I did play over 220 hours in BO3 but statement is correct. At least for me.  Before I started campaign I knew what it'll be about, but I thought the game will have two parts - future one and past one. When I realized that it will be past then future then past and so on, I was thinking that it is not good, because now you get used to real enviroment you know from previous games and you really enjoy it, and after a while you are thrown into future and then you go back again, but I have to admit, after 3rd mission I really loved it.   Storrytelling is again absolutely amazing, equal and maybe better than BO1. I just love the idea that they put son of Alex Mason in the game, and even more I love the idea that they put Frank Woods in the game. Hell, I even more love the idea that they put certain someone. I saw somewhere discussion if Raul is any good villain in comparision with Zakhaev and/or Makarov. My answer is that he's not any good, but he is the best. For me tho. The very best and I am not even kidding. How could Makarov be bigger evil than Raul? How?  Locations and nature of the mission is again simply beautiful. Diversity at its top. The past missions in terms of diversity are two steps ahead of any CoD so far for me. Future levels have a little bit of variety too, no worries. Horse mission was one of the best. I remember that I did preview about BO2 back in early 2012 where I said that there'll be horses. Guess what, nobody believed.  I do have feeling that strike missions was really useless. They each have aprox. 10 minutes. Some you can finish in 2, and they really do not carry any big meaning. The story is like 6-7 hours and I just wish if it was at least 10-15. And if not that certain lenght, they could at least explain more and show more about Alex & David and of course Raul deserved more insights after the end of game. Not just headbutt to TV.  To address price point of the game, yes I know it is high. It is worth? Definitely.  Will the base price point goes down anywhere soon?  Listen guys, there is no reason. Activision is not that kind of the company that listen to the fanbase. And as long as they are making profit (do not worry, they do make money on it still after years) price will not go down by any big piece any time soon.  Gameplay, enviroment, locations, characters, story, storytelling, weapon selection, missions and once again characters are truly amazing. Graphics for me really doesn't matter and we all now how CoD stands in terms of graphics. Music and sounds are brilliant too. As always I'm not going to rate multiplayer, zombies and downloadable content yet.  Bonus Point: Manuel Noriega Rating: 8/10 ","hours":16.2}

{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.9640284683802848,"review":"Zombies Review A side game mode born from a mere project 9 years ago became one of the most known CoD playlist to this day. Casual or hardcore Zombies is appealing to everyone that's a fan of smashing hordes of unending undead that charge at you from every corner of the map. Sadly it will never receive full attention from 3arch since Activi$ion's main focus is only revenue, yet 3arch has managed to enrich it title by title accomplishing what Zombies is known as today. Grief is also an exclusive sub game mode to BOII which puts 4 players against 4 players in team deathmatch Zombies style existent in 3 maps.  Green Run (TranZit) Definitely one of the most hated if not most hated map to this day, many people don't realize without this test map we wouldn't have the buildables system that is present in every map after TranZit. A very eerie experience with the whole area covered in fog haunted by little creatures that hug your face every time you trespass their territory. Map also features a bus drove by one auto-bot that doesn't appreciate hostility towards it and will kick you out mercilessly leaving you fresh dinner for the undead. While it lacks a powerful wonder weapon TranZit can be played as survival in closed off areas which brings a bit easier time surviving all around. While Town & Farm are albeit smaller similar to classic survival maps Bus Depot is truly a hardcore zone with nothing but the mystery box.  Nuketown In my opinion the least played and talked about 3rc brought this map originally from BO in BOII in both MP and Zombies, while it is indeed small it's packed with a bunch of easter eggs that tell pieces of the story. Absence of a wonder weapon which would have filled many strategies' missing link is not enough to ruin and belittle it that many exiled it for; Nuketown is a hardcore mini-map designed not for the faint-hearted where perks drop near you from the freakin' Moon. It's little known the events in Nevada occur at the same time as the events in the last BO map, Moon, if you survive enough time you can tell by clues that pop up.  Die Rise One of the least memorable BOII maps Skyscraper features a unique map design within Zombies universe with lots of heights. Classic perk-a-cola PhD Flopper is teased but unreachable; truth be told it would ruin the whole idea of the map taking no fall damage. The Hellhound round also returns introducing Jumping Jacks, agile cousins of gas zombies that teleport and jump from ceiling to your face however their low health makes up for the annoyance. 3arc tried to innovate a new Quick Revive but from many's point of view failed to do so as Who's Who is a gamble depending on whichever area of the map you got downed.   Mob of The Dead Creepiest experience by far in the BOII universe that occurs within the famous Alcatraz Island featuring a new game mechanic called Afterlife mode. It can be used in various ways such as self or reviving teammates, levitate through walls/doors opening up parts of the map or simply zapping zombies away teleporting them to ease up your recovery after being downed. It's one of the few maps with an upgradable wonder weapon that's mandatory in a long term strategy against the waves of endless undead. Sunset Strip also starring the notorious Brutus a fearsome mini-boss that doesn't have it's own round but randomly spawns whenever you use the mystery box too much or apart every few rounds; while not as deadly he's a tank that will chase you throughout the whole island given that you don't have a powerful weapon to rid him rapidly.  Buried Well known to be the easiest map that only casual fans tend to enjoy the map brings more than few new things to the Zombies experience. NPC you can ignore or aid in which he'll give you an easier time surviving in this old west town. To pack-a-punch your weapons you'll have to trespass a mansion haunted by ghosts that will steal your hard earned points, then finding your path through a maze which changes it's layout every time you exit it. What brings down the difficulty is how little effort you need to survive being able to use 3 traps that instantly kill zombies at the same time, same location.  Origins Fan's favorite and the biggest non stop action packed map featured in BOII with arguably most fun mechanics and replay value. When you talk about Dig Site you can't help but remember the 4 different iconic staffs which overpower the undead in a fashionable way with blizzards, lava, tornados and lightning chains. Aside that you can ride a freakin' tank throughout the map while falcon punching the undead meters away showing 'em who's boss, nevermind the G-Strike nades rainstorming the field with napalm. Undeniably Origins has an abundance of things to do for hours with a single downside tons of mini-puzzles required to unlock them.

Yes!  The Singleplayer  So once again you play as an unstoppable killing machine. What makes this campaign stand out, however, is the fact that your actions and choices actually change the outcome of the game. There are about 4 different endings. Each triggered by the choices/actions you make and or take.  There's also some little consequences that just scar some of your \"teammates\".  Having different endings in a FPS is a very rare thing. Let alone the fact that the ending depends on the actions you take. In Deus Ex: Human Revolution your actions didn't matter at all. In the end you just chose between four different endings. This is not the case in here. In here the ending depends on what you did on the road...making this story more dynamic and even beats some of the RPGs when it comes to affecting the world/story you're in. - Looking at you Mass Effect 3 and Skyrim - No matter what you do in these games, it doesn't matter. Yes, both are good games but you have no effect on the world or the story...yet they call themselves RPGs.   Call of Duty: Black Ops II created a good and dynamic campaign that should set a new par to all FPSs but unfortunatelly this little but important aspect of the game is overlooked just because \"hurpdurr it's another CoD\"...so what ? This CoD tried! Tried and succeeded!  The gameplay itself is your old-known CoD gameplay and we're glad that it's back! Admit it! If CoD would change their gameplay then there would be a lot of angry people out there. Would you like CS to change the gameplay ? NO! People got angry at DICE when they made character movement more smooth in Battlefield...there's no pleasing people. The character movement is, however, a bit smoother than in the previous CoDs and that makes the game a bit more enjoyable. Especially in the multiplayer.  The Multiplayer  I put around 150-160 hours into the multiplayer and I still have nothing to say about it...it's good. So far i've only enjoyed 3 CoD multiplayers: CoD4, MW2 and Blops2. So Blops 2 is in my top 3 Call of Duty games. - This is saying a lot! CoD4 and MW2 are considered the best CoD games even by the hardcore CoD haters!  The multiplayer in Blops2 is well balanced, gives you a lot of freedom (in class creation), makes it easier to record gameplay footages and is just simple fun. The only issue i have, with the multiplayer, is that it uses matchmaking instead of having a simple server list. It's still a very good multiplayer experience and i would recommend it to all kinds of FPS fans!   The game is definitely worth the full price. Only good CoD game on the market that's worth the full price! +Different choices and endings add replay value to the 8-12h campaign making it a 16-48h campaign. +Fun and balanced multiplayer that for the first time really lets you play the way YOU prefer. +Co-op zombie modes -No server list  You don't need to own any DLCs to fully enjoy this title ","hours":13.3}

Its not easy to review this game because there are many pro and cons, but at the end I decited to give it a thumb up.  Singleplayer  I played the Singleplayercampaign for a few hours and stopped playing it than because of the following reasons:  You should play the campaign of Cod-Black Ops 1 before playing this one because there are some important connections, which help you to understand the campaign much better. The Grafics are not up to date thinking about a Battlefield 3 and Crysis. The Story is not really fascinating and there is no variety just thinking about the repetitive gunfights. The Levels are built linearly  EDIT: I bought Call of Duty Black Ops now and played that campaign as well. Now its much easier to understand this one.  Multiplayer  The focuse of the game is clearly the Multiplayerpart of the game. I played it now for >23 hours and had tons of fun in there. I like this fast actiongameplay of Call of Duty. Especially with friends it makes even more fun, if your in the same team or not does not really matter. I dont know if I am the only one who observed that, but the multiplayermaps like Nukedown and Hijacked were much more beautiful than the locations in the singleplayercampaign.  Fazit  In the end Call of Duty Black Ops II gets a 7/10 from me, but only because of the Multiplayerpart.  I really hope Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare brings us better grafics. \"Its not the most important thing in games\" many people say, but if they are soo bad it does not make that much fun.","hours":17.1}
