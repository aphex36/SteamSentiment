I felt so bad that I just didn't have a lot of time to hang out with him, with work and school and my own personal selfishness. Then I bought Castle Crashers. It was ok, especially for an old title.

{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.8810701224358813,"review":"Introduction:  Castle Crashers was my personal favorite Xbox Live Arcade game when it was first released back in 2008. The Behemoth continued to give this game more life with it's DLC of character's that had unique abilities, animal orbs that would accompany you throughout the game, and weapons that would improve your character's growth (or vice versa if you are looking for a challenge). The game was later ported to the Playstation Network with exclusive mini-games in 2010. Castle Crashers eventually was ported onto Steam, but was ported badly onto PC on launch; however, the game was redeemed to be fun and playable again after The Behemoth made necessary updates.   Verdict:  This title is a hack and slash RPG, and has been widely recieved by many gamers who appreciate the genre (even those who don't). The game can feel a bit tedious at times, but as you level your character(s) the gameplay will feel slightly different before it tends to get repetitive once again. However, the game keeps the game fresh upon every level with unique scenary, opponents, and even jokes. If you plan on purchasing this title it's obviously more fun to play it with friends then it is with complete strangers, so try to convince your friends (and if they've convinced you to buy it listen to them). Completing the title will be a mission, but personally I think that's half the fun of trying to unlock every single character, find every animal orb and weapons. Give this game a try by downloading the demo. If you find the game a bit pricey than wait for a discount (or a Humble Indie Bundle that has this game packaged with it).","hours":26.1}

{"funny_percent":0.06363636363636363,"helpful_percent":0.9157370468628622,"review":"Castle Crashers is a 2D beat 'em up with some RPG elements. I'd heard a lot of people talk it up and even tried the demo before deciding to get this bad boy when it was on sale for Halloween. You get four characters to choose from, so you can potentially play a 1-4 player game right out of the gate. Each character has their own starting weapon, magical element, and appearance. You go through levels beating up bad guys and trying to save princesses. Along the way, you'll find some cool weapons and animal orbs that give you special perks, You can switch between them between levels by visiting the blacksmith. I don't typically enjoy beat 'em ups. They tend to get stale and boring, despite how many combos or different weapons the game wants to throw my way. But Castle Crashers adds in some RPG elements to keep it interesting. Sure, the different weapons, different characters with their magic, and different animal buddies all add some customization, but the leveling system is what truly gives this game replayability and a sense of progression. Upon leveling up, you'll gain points that can be put into any of the four stats you have, strength, defense, magic, and agility. Depending on what kind of playstyle you want to use or what role you have on the team, you can build accordingly. Do you want to focus on one or two stats? Or would you rather be more well rounded? How will you compliment your teammates? Or what is best for solo play? It gives some complexity to the otherwise simple concept, which is great.   The ability to play locally, cooperatively, or solo is nice for varied options and experiences. Essentially, each character you use equals one campaign. And there are a lot of unlockable characters, so this game does have a lot of replayability and lifespan. I also like the simple cartoony art style and some of the music is pretty cool. The main game with single and multiplayer, insane mode, two mini games, achievements, there's a lot of hours to be had with this title.   However, I DO need to point out a few flaws in the game. Castle Crashers is a game of diminishing returns. When you start, there's lots of new and exciting things to keep you hooked. New characters, new weapons, new animal buddies, new secondary items, new levels, and a blank slate to upgrage how you see fit. But after a while... it loses its luster. There are only so many characters, items, animal buddies, weapons, and levels in the game. Your upgrades get harder and harder to improve as the game goes on and you will start to gain less points per level. You max out at 78 and from then on it's very little change between levels. Insane mode, aside from a few exceptions, is basically the same as the normal game... excpet enemies take longer to kill and can kill you faster. More frustrating and time consuming than an increase in challenge. Also, the online isn't always the best. It depends on game settings, connection speeds, and the locations of the players for sure, but laggy games can be tough to get through, especially in crucial moments the requre precision. Not to mention that when the game literally has to stop and wait for the other players, it can get very annoying and tiresome. So I'd recommend finding people close enough for online, or simply doing local play if you're going to do multiplayer.  I like Castle Crashers. Sure, it has diminishing returns, and if you want to complete it with everyone at maximum everything... you'll be playing longer than you enjoy. But playing in moderation, trying to win rather than max everything, playing with other people... all of this can easily extend the playtime of the game while keeping it fun. Is it worth $15? Well... it really depends. If you like beat 'em ups a lot, then probably. Try out the demo and gauge your excitement. I'd say this game is probably worth about $10 generally, and when it goes on sale it tends to be cheaper anyway, so definitely go for it. I'd give Castle Crashers a solid 7/10. A good game, great for fans of beat 'em ups, but still alright for people who don't much care for them as well. I'm sure I'll get lots of hours in this game over the years, and you might too.","hours":30.2}

It has a super great and funny story line that makes this one great adventure. Graphics looks amazing and the themes are well through of. You play through the levels to save the 4 princesses from the evil kings. This may sound a bit boring ? but on the contrary, the game has a very nice story. You bash and shoot your way through levels and woop everything in your way. Discover new land, animals, weapons and much much more.    Core Gameplay: ============ You can choose in the beginning the 4 basic characters from the game. These are Fire, Toxic, Ice and Electric Castle Crashers. All of these have there own special powers you can throw at your enemies. You have a level up system so that makes it extra addicting to play this game. And you can choice how you like to upgrade you character as you wish. You give more points to magic you will unlock new skills. Or try to be strong as the hulk and place the points on strength. You can discover new animals they will give you more power health, XP or just find things for you. After all these finding animals and leveling your character. You can also find new weapons and give this a extra twist to your character. What is cool about every weapon is that it haves his own stats that will give you sometime extra like, speed, strength or magic powers so an extra advantage to you character so it’s not about the weapons looks it’s what stats you will need because of the play style you choose.   Overall: ====== This games has some amazing soundtracks and levels. Play these with your friends online and offline. Enjoy and fall in love with this great Beat 'm Up !!

Hack n' Slash your way to glorious victory with a few poop jokes along the way.  Castle Crashers is an Action Co-op Beat 'em up Flash game! Developed by The Behemoth, originating from their popular website, http://www.newgrounds.com/. Knowing that, the game comes with hilarious, but crude sense of humor, which is all part of the game's special charm. The game is all hand-drawn in Flash, giving it a nice and colorful artstyle that adds a cartoonish appeal to the game. Additionally, most of the music in Castle Crashers are submitted by loyal Newgrounds fans!  Hack! Slash! Smash! Abracadabra! The gameplay is what makes this game great. It's your usual beat 'em up formula, with light and heavy attacks, performing combos and such. But in addition to that, you have the ability to cast magic! Controls the elements as you spark fire, summon icicles, conduct electricity, fling poison and throw buzz saws? Castle Crashers also features RPG elements, as you gain EXP for every hit, and with enough EXP, you level up! Granting you points in which you could assign to either physical or magical power!  The Evil Wizard has kidnapped the King's daughters! The story can't be much simpler than this. As your king's loyal knights, you venture off to save the 4 princesses that has been taken away by the evil clutches of the Final Boss! You journey through war fields, forests, deserts, snow lands and many more as you battle various bosses such as barbarians, trolls, robots, dragons and aliens! Whenever you save one of the princesses, the true battle begins, as you and your friends fight to the death to win the princess' kiss! During your free time, you're free to participate in other game modes such as Arena; as you duel your friends gladiator style, and Back Off Barbarian; where you and your friends escape in this tricky tile-based mini-game!  Journey alone or adventure with your buddies with up to four players! Either local, online, or hell, even both! You can select from a variety of knights, each with their own unique magical element, with many more unlockable characters as you play through the game. You can also select from a variety of weapons and pets, or \"animal orbs\" as the game calls them along the way, as most of them are cleverly hidden all across the map. However, this becomes a problem for most unlockable characters involve beating the game as certain other characters, then beating them game with those newly unlocked characters. Most of the characters are pretty much the same anyway for they share similar magic, while certain ones break the game from how Overpowered they are. While the game is relatively short and fun, it could be bothersome to most who plans to unlock everything.  Final Verdict! While the game is fun alone, it is strongly recommended playing with friends. The game is unfortunately dying, so there are not many people playing online that often, so it's best to just host private games with friends. While unlocking more characters, animal orbs and weapons can be fun, it's still dependent on the player if they're into that sort of thing, and if they're willing to play the game numerous times just to achieve them.  Grab the game when you can! Get the 4-pack, even! The game went as low as 90% off on sale, so you have no reason not to get it! And when you do start playing, don't play as any of the DLC characters for your first playthrough, for they do not unlock any new characters if you beat the game as them. Despite all these flaws, I'm a fan of it myself, so if you need someone to play with, give me a holler and we'll crash some castles together!","hours":127.5}

{"funny_percent":0.08064516129032258,"helpful_percent":0.7395445728953095,"review":"I'm going to look at Castle Crashers from two points of view: casual and hardcore. Now I'm fully aware that \"casual\" is a dirty word when it comes to videogames. Honestly, I think a game being casual is a good thing. If I'm playing a lot of hardcore games, the kind with a lot of depth, high punishments for failure, and an extreme level of difficulty; I'm going to want something to fall back on. In this regard, Castle Crashers fits the bill.  However, a lot of games - sometimes the best ones - can appeal to both the casual and hardcore gamers. These titles offer a perfect learning curve and are enjoyable at any skill-level. There are multiple methods for playing through them. The challenge can range from easy to improbable. It all depends on how the player approaches these games. Though it tries, Castle Crashers can't bridge this gap. It's a fine game for a friendly get-together, or a time-sink on a slow day. If you're looking for a quality brawler, the kind you can keep coming back to again and again, then look elsewhere.  I hate to say it, but this review isn't over yet.  Looking further, Castle Crashers works as a casual game due to the constant thread of \"niceties\". These are moments that make you say \"Oh. That's nice.\" when they happen. Leveling up, the discovery of a new weapon or animal, a dead enemy dropping a valuable crystal instead of a mere coin; these are all examples of niceties. The game is further bolstered by simplistic but charming hack & slash action. Through the combination of both elements, as well as flavor touches like the set-piece battles and action sequences, this game works. It just plain works.  Even with this casual approach, you're still bound to run into problems. The balance between strength, magic, and agility is crap. Magic and agility require huge investments to attain any noticeable effect. Strength is an absolute necessity, unless you want to juggle foes for several minutes at a time. The ranged options are only forced onto the player by the rare appearance of giant enemies. You know who these jerks are, because you can't get close to them, without being grabbed and thrown.  Also, while the niceties are appreciated, I believe that Behemoth could have done a little better. Character-unlocking is just plain awful after a certain point. Having to replay the entire game with character F to unlock character M is maddening. It's especially bad when A) all characters behave the same outside of spells B) every character starts at level 1 and C) there aren't any methods for passing experience onto new characters. Dynasty Warriors is a franchise with gobs of playable heroes, and usually there's some method for strengthening unused characters, so everyone remains at a level playing field. In Castle Crashers, this -admittedly not all that important - element was overlooked, and it's pretty annoying.  The insane mode is ironically where hardcore gamers are liable to get the door slammed in their faces. This is also where the game almost completely falls apart. A high difficulty mode is fine, but it needs to make sense. Insane difficulty features faster and more aggressive enemies, so it's good on that front. Unfortunately, their HP and especially their strength have recieved a massive multiplier, and that's really bad. A number of enemies and bosses go from non-threatening to entirely absurd. For most players, insane mode ends with the large troll of the Thieves' Forest.  This is my third play-through of the game, and I still don't understand why insane mode exists. In the original Xbox 360 version, insane mode was somewhat mitigable, due to a prevalent experience glitch (involving the troll boss). This is one of those rare glitches that actually made the game worse when it was fixed. Depending on how you look at it, abusing an XP glitch to make a game easier probably isn't very hardcore. As far as I'm concerned, insane mode is where the game actively cheats. Everyone has too much HP and does too much damage, but apparently it's unfair for players to have something to fall back on.   Personally, I would have suggested difficulty modifiers (ala Bastion) instead of a difficulty mode, but this a 20/20 hindsight suggestion. I certainly didn't have the idea, when Castle Crashers was released, back in 2008. All told, this game is still pretty enjoyable and even better with friends. Just don't invest too much of your energy, because the pay-off isn't worth the effort.","hours":6.6}

The Campaign is the main source of fun, the levels are different, the challenges unique and the bosses cool. But they best way to experience this game is not solo (although you can) but through the wonderful co-op. This is where the game shines as you share your adventure with up to three buddies. After you finish the standard campaign Insane mode will unlock with all the New Game+ fun and challenge. The only thing I can point out as glitchy here is that progress updates strangely and sometimes you have to re-do a level because it won't save for your friends (or you, if you are not the server). Arena is fun competitive fighting and Back Off Barbarian is precise button pressing alone or with a friend. Each character has their own save and XP progress. You can unlock lots of character, weapons and tiny animals to help out. Fighting is responsive with options between ranged (archery, magic) and melee. Playing with keyboard is really doable but feels suboptimal. Mainly because your fingers start to hurt real quick. There are a lot of combos and tons of button mashing and a good gamepad helps with this. Behemoth humor and art-style are awesome in all of their games, Castle Crashers are no exception. This makes for a great game and one of the best co-op games currently on Steam for both casual and hardcore gamers.

Castle Crashers has a lot to offer to those special groups, composed of four friends, as you'll find your team gaining experience, learning new unique moves in combat and fighting to the death of every chapter, all with a touch of humour. This game reaks of Indie-goodness and it goes for a fact that I love that type of game producing and development; Independently made, tying in nicely together, to make a labour of love.  I love the particular 'crude' and simplistic art style this game has. Coming from the beloved artist, Dan Paladin, his ingenius creativity is best said as beautiful and completely staggering. Every character has a ''comic-component'' to them, including their emotions being presented in that of a slap-stick type of fashion. Interaction with random NPC's and the wacky medieval environments are top-notch and goofy and the rest can be left as fun. What more could be said?  The game's appeal and genre, being in the typical 2-D Adventure Beat 'em Up hybrid, relates to the classic and retro games like Golden Axe for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, the classic Arcade game, Final Fight and even dating way back to Double Dragon and Battletoads for the NES. All of which shrouds you in a distant yet cherished memory, while this game adapts to its own heartwarming and charmful stylish nature. If you have played all of these previous games or other games that shares this joyful genre, you will most likely adapt to this game's control with pure expert skill.  The game's mechanics are very immersive and easy enough to figure out even for first timers. Most battle systems work in waves; with a certain number of enemies that increase in power as you progress and defeat all enemies in a specific wave, which lets you advance further within a level. Most levels end in with a big boss battle, where your techniques, might and agility is put to the test, as you'll take down numerous tyrants and beasts, again with all a touch of humour and creative cartoon-ish atmospheres. All of this, to uphold the traditional tale of medieval times, where a brave knight will rise up and save the princess, either from evil tyrants, corrupt kings or beasts and the much darker figure that is behind the game's plot overall.  Though this game is impeccable and fun with friends, this little gem doesn't seperate itself from its own fair share of problems. First of all, I find the controllability with the keyboard a little finicky and hard to manoeuvre when you're on the field, smashing vikings and gladiators alike. Understandably, the game does warn you right from the very beginning that a controller is highly recommended, but it doesn't distinguish the fact that a keyboard is optional and here's where I think a little more work should've been put in. Another problem I keep running into is the multiplayer connectivity. Me, neither of my mates who I've played Castle Crashers with had no internet connection problems at all, while the game seems to freeze, not respond and generally lags while in-game.   To me, this game is one of the biggest icons, to serve off as inspiration to even those small Independent game developers who will hopefully get their projects recognized around. As well as a big Indie-icon, a definite recommendation from me as you will soon find out that many people have this in their own game library. I will conclude this review by saying that this game is just that damn good.","hours":5.8}

You start out with four characters,  red (Lightning), orange, (Fire), blue (Ice,) and green (Poison). Four princesses have been captured and you must rescue them to finish the game. Complete the game with the knights above to earn more characters. There are many bosses to fight, pets to collect, and swords to discover. Upgrade your strength (Damage), magic, defense (Health), and agility (Speed and arrow damage), as you progress through the game.   The graphics are nice and fit the game well too, gameplay is really good also. If you buy it you should probably get a controller. It works using a keyboard, but is alot easier with a controller.  Overall, I would rate this game 10/10.","hours":116.6}

Though it can be done, single-player assaults are more frustrating and less enjoyable than teaming up with other people. The biggest issue in trying to take on levels solo is that multiple enemies can assault you with ranged attacks, making it difficult to even stand up before being knocked down again. Animal orbs are probably my favorite thing in Castle Crashers because they're just so damn cute.  PRESENTATION:  The story is straightforward and the game is easy to pick up and play.  GRAPHICS:  Everything is beautifully drawn and animated.  SOUND:  The digital, techno tunes are upbeat and perfect background music for raising hell.  GAMEPLAY:  Classic side-scrolling brawler gameplay mixed up with fun boosts and magic makes for a great time with friends. Slightly busted multiplayer is a downer though.  LASTING APPEAL:  The campaign is short, but there are multiple characters to unlock, lots of weapons and animals to unlock and 99 levels to max out, making it a game you can spend some serious time with.   Two other negatives:  The game is not worth the high price. Buy it on sale instead. It can be rather repetetive.  6/10","hours":13.7}

{"funny_percent":0.18181818181818182,"helpful_percent":0.9167240141779256,"review":"This game is what I would call a classic of the modern gaming era. It's not exactly new, but it still manages to keep a certain freshness to it, which is actually quite impressive.   When I say \"classic\", I mean a game that is a sort of important pillar to gaming in general. Now, I wouldn't say that it changed the whole industry per say, but I still consider this one to be a game that is part of my childhood to an extend. Many can possibly relate to that thought, I'd wager.  Now, what exactly is Castle Crashers? Well, to resume the whole experience in a single sentence, it's basically a \"smash right through the enemies, save the princesses and defeat the evil king\". Sounds simple, doesn't it? That's no surprise; because this game is simple.   The true experience truly comes to life when you bring a friend or two along the ride. As most multiplayer games, having someone to play with you really is a must to enjoy the full adventure. Honestly, playing through this game alone is kind of boring, and considering that the designs of the levels highly support multiplayer, trying to go through the game alone can prove to be a chore. Then again, I did play and finish it alone the first time, but when I replayed it with a few folks, my overall opinion changed drastically.  This game is huge. Don't let the tiny sixteen bucks tell you otherwise; it's probably one of the biggest adventures I've seen for a Smash 'em up. The adventure itself isn't much to speak about, my friends and I started from the beginning and finished after around four sessions of one hour each. What makes this thing so huge is the unlockable content. There are a ton of them, such as characters, pets, weapons, levels, and even a secret difficulty. You'll be grinding and repeating the same levels many times to find rare items and weapons if completion matters to you.   I'd like to speak about the difficulty, since I feel like difficulty is something that matters for many players and buyers. The game in itself isn't harshly hard. Most bosses have simple patterns, the level designs can be either fair or sometimes overwhelming, and the overall product will not make you frustrated to the point of screaming. Of course, I won't say that it is an easy game either; sometimes it feels like the game throws so much at you, I find it almost unfair. Without spoiling too much, the final boss in particular has a lot of annoying patterns that can drag for a while, especially if alone.  Upon finishing the game, you will have the option of changing to an even harder difficulty. I will warn you : It is cheap. Enemies are insanely powerful, and quite frankly, it's not fun. If that sounds appealing to you, then go ahead and try it. I, for one, will stay away and advices you to do so as well.  The game has two primary mechanics : Physical attacks and Magical moves. Physical attacks are, as the name says, attacks with weapons. The damage that you will do to enemies is generated by how much points to give to your Physical stats. Magical moves are attacks composed of magic. Giving points to this stat will not only grow your magical abilities and make them more powerful, it will also make the range and overall usefulness much more adaptable.   The best idea would be to try to make a balanced knight, since enemies later on will either be extremely resistant to Physical attacks or highly resistant to Magic. You always need to have an alternative, or else it becomes truly bothersome.    I believe that I mentioned every aspects worth mentioning. This game is great, and while not a masterpiece by any means, it should prove itself quite worthy of your purchase. Do not forget to try and ask a few friends if they wish to play along!","hours":55.1}

So my cousin, brother and I we're goofing around on the Xbox then my cousin said while browsing the xbox store said this game looks cool lets try it! We bought it downloaded it and launched it. I was the Blue Knight my brother was the orange, and my cousin was the red. we got to lava world then me and my brother had to go. My brother and I pleaded our father to buy it too. We ended up convincing him, so we all three of us played it til wedding crash then my bro had to go. and me and my father got to Full Moon, then I had to go to my mom's. the next weekend I went to my dad's I convinced my little sister (5 at the time) To play castle crashers. And since then me and her played it soooooo much. then came when my brother got back into it, me and him were fire and ice like before, but im lvl 58 and hes lvl 61 we both played to the final boss, turned out we were overleveled and it was too easy so we went to insane mode to die to the barbarian boss multiple times. He gave up on it, so I continued to play it alot with my sister. she now has lvl 70 posion knight and rn on the xbox cc im 98 ice knight. 3 Years later I got steam, and played it alot. And when I figured out Castle Crashers was on steam I freaked out. I've played it alot ever since, and still play it.

I was on the fence about this one because of the art style, and it looked like a kids game. I ended up picking it up on a Steam sale for my son, who wanted it. To my surprise this game is a blast. You pick one of four knights each with a special ability. Fire, Poison, Electricity, Ice, you get the idea. The powers give you a special attack that does significant damage, as well as decides the color of your knight. The game supports full controller, local co-op, online co-op, and local plus online co-op. This is the way it should be. Local co-op, and split screen belong on PC! The game features three modes, campaign, versus, and a jumping mini game (not my cup of tea, but some may like jumping). The campaign mode is where it's at. You, and up to three friends button mash your way to victory against the evil horde to save the princesses. The combat gives you some options aside from hack n slash, like your special power, bow, bomb, and a few simple combos. The music is great, they did a nice job on the tracks for this game. The monster design is comical, and slicing the heads off little minions is fun. The game will run on almost any PC (Not your Commodore 64, but anything from 2010 and up should be fine). If you've been passing on this one, give it a try at the next sale.  OLDER GAMER APPROVED POTATO PC CERTIFIED  Visit our Currator Page","hours":6.8}

'Now considering I took a 4 year hiatus, I'm sure a relatively large sum of you guys reading this review are in the same position as me.....'   I was first introduced into the wacky world of Castle Crashers back in 2008 via the mini flash-game Castle Crashing \"The Beard.\" Back then, Kongregate was the king and it quickly became my favourite platformer. Despite the simplicity of the artwork and game mechanics, the game had character and it was obvious that the developers weren't afraid to show off their work against the smorgasbord of stereotypically depicted knights, castles and overworked medieval warfare.  Well a few months later, it was announced that Castle Crashing \"The Beard\" would fully mature into a proper side-scrolling beat-em-up platformer with an actual story (like fighting a giant beard would be believable lel)! While I was quickly swept away by the hype, I wasn't an Xbox owner and the prospects of getting one just for Castle Crashers weren't high. And so after beating the flash version a few times, I slowly let go of the unattainable and moved onto other things.  4 years later, things had certainly changed; games were easily attainable now that I had become a successful Steam trader and suddenly out of the blue, Castle Crashers appeared on the Store page! So much time had passed that embarrassingly, the switch inside my head didn't immediately click... I saw the 4 knights and noticed the mellow colours but couldn't put my hand on why they were so familiar.. After a quick google search of \"Crashing beard game\" my mind became frantic, the impossible was finally possible, I HAD to play this game!!  Now considering I took a 4 year hiatus, I'm sure a relatively large sum of you guys reading this review are in the same position as me. While the flash-version was extremely addictive, Castle Crashers is a refreshing rendition.  Here are a few reasons for which Castle Crashers is a must-buy for people in the same position as I was: The simplicity of the fighting mechanics and overall movement has been entirely conserved. Artwork and soundtrack stays true to the original version :). Extensive storyline that will take you through an epic journey where you will meet the most creatively designed foes. Local and Online Multiplayer! Ability to play as other characters other than the 4 knights including...Pink Knight :D:D:D (Yes, Pink knight from Crashing Beard is in this game with his lollipop sword!!!!!)  Now unfortunately there are a few downsides: Latency issues and lag when playing with others across the world (Yes it's an old game, luckily its smoother with peers who live closer to you). Few features and special attacks are missing from the flash-version including Orange Knight's special pheonix attack.  Grinding: there will be unavoidable moments where you will need to grind certain stages of the game in which you will need to repeat certain levels to kill enemies due to the simplicity of the game's levelling system. For each character, you will need to spend a few hours on the same level to be able to play insane mode.  Fortunately a few of these issues will be addressed in the Remastered edition to be released later this year (2015) including performance improvements - especially in online multiplayer. If you don't enjoy the grinding, just play with a friend, the social interaction will definitely put the boring aspects of the game to ease ;)  Overall, I definitely do recommend Castle Crashers, if you loved the game on Kongregate or Newgrounds and don't trust the \"overwhelmingly positive\" review rating, let me assure you that it is undeniably worth it's weight in gold.  Also the game does drop to $1.49 and usually below $5 during the Steam sales so there is absolutely no reason why you shouldn't give it a try!","hours":17.7}
