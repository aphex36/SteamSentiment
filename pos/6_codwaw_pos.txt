There was a time where snipers camped and didn't run around quick scoping.  There was a time where submachine gunners ran around and didn't camp in corners.

There was a time where 2-3 bullets actually killed you instead of 10-12. There was a time where shotguns weren't OP. There was a time where 12 year olds didn't sleep with your mom.

This way you aren't stuck playing the same 4 zombie maps. There are hundreds of custom maps featuring customized weapons, camos, perks, scenery, storylines, objectives, game modes, and much more! Would definitely recommend this game to any FPS zombie lover out there. A+ in my book!

I remember playing the campaign and enjoying it and being scared by the zombie mode that was unlocked upon finishing the game. During this time I didn't have internet so I couldn't play online. Due to this I always played with my dad. I believe that lasted for a couple months and I begged my dad to get the internet set up so I could play with other people. Call of Duty: World at War was my first online game and it was a great experience.   Campaign: - I would say the campaign in this game is fairly average, but one of the best Call of Duty campaigns. - You can play all, but two missions cooperatively.  Multiplayer: - Personally, I thought this game had the best multiplayer out of all the Call of Duty games. I loved playing Hardcore Headquarters, Hardcore Search and Destroy, and War. - Unfortunetly, this games feels basically dead these days and I don't really see a reason to play it. - On PC there is a problem where you get kicked from games for no reason by Punk Buster.  Zombies: - This game comes with four fun zombie maps upon purchase. - There are loads and loads of custom maps to play - Four player coop.  I honestly can't think of any negative things to say about this game. If you're looking for a game to play custom zombie maps this is the game for you!","hours":84.5}

Call of Duty: World at War is not a masterpiece but it is a damn good game. The gameplay is simply COD4 with a different era. Its fun, fast, and arcadie. The single player is alright with a couple of interesting characters. Nothing worth praising here but a lot of enjoyment is to be had from the campaing.  Multiplayer is still alive and active. The servers are very fun to play in and have a lot of active players on them. WaW's multiplayer is very fun and solid. It may have a couple of cheap moments like any other COD has. But it is still very enjoyable and can keep you entertained for a couple of hours.  As always I leave the best for last. Zombies! Call of Duty: World at War's zombie mode is one of the best co-op experiences I have ever had. Its fun, gameplay is solid, theres a story, and it will give you and your friends hours upon hours of entertainment. The game comes with 4 solid maps to play on. Natch Der Untoten, Verruckt, Shi No Numa, and Der Riese. These maps offer great variety and are very fun to play in. Zombies is the biggest and most alive part of this game. With a community that has created thousands upon thousands of custom zombie maps that one can enjoy. Many map makers like ZCT and TMG provide high quality maps that can be compared to Treyarch's best.   You still reading eh? Go and buy this game NOW! Yeah thats right, NOW!

In terms of system requirements and gameplay fluency, I was beyond surprised with how well this game runs. I was running a full 60 FPS flawless, even on the higher-paced Zombies mod, which honestly is the only saving grace in Call of Duty.  The singleplayer was pretty interesting, too; it was a cool campaign of WWII taking place on two fronts against two highly different enemies - the Japanese favor unconventional, barbaric and suicidal attacks which provide challenge for the close-quarters-oriented United States Marines, and Hitler's Angels go against the Soviets in a longer-ranged conflict.  The weaponry feels so unique and abstract from other installments of this otherwise putrid franchise, though that primarily comes from the gore effects in this game. Watching enemies' limbs go flying off when I blast them off with a pump-action shotgun reminds me of many years ago when I played this game on the Xbox 360.  So World at War provides an entertaining singleplayer, which also has the equivalent of Halo's \"skulls\" (difficulty and game modifiers that provide either more challenging or easier effects in the gameplay) and cooperative campaign gameplay (it did on the Xbox, at least; I'm almost positive it does on the PC), and the Zombies mode is at its strongest and purest roots. It's tragic when the series' (Zombies) origins are the best version of it.  Oh, and it's World War II, not this futuristic Titanfall wannabe ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.
