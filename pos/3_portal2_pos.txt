If you already know a thing or two or hate reading, visit my Pros and Cons section as it helped many customers decide if this game is right for them! ------------------------------- Intro You know how when you are on vacation and say, \"I am so glad it isn't winter right now.\"? Yeah, that sums up the power this game has on you. When you play the game, it is so...crisp (Vacation-like) and when you have to leave, it is like that miserable winter I was talking about. ------------------------------- Summary: This game, as you should know from some other reviews and through the fact that it is one of the best selling games of all time, leaves an effect on the player. It is a beautiful story-line. You play as a female test subject through the campaign. She (I won't spoil her name) is forced through many tests GLaDOS (a powerful robot who took over Aperture) has prepared for her. You learn a lot about this character as you portal around puzzles of rooms, and a lot is learned about yourself. The programed-to-be \"idiot\" (whom you will find out through the game) is something to look out for as you think he is helping you escape. It is a clever twist. You will learn that the industry you are escaping from used to be a shower curtain/part factory. Yeah, It will all make sense when you play.  ------------------------------- Multi-Player Then there is the multi-player mode with Atlas and P-body who are trying to free the humans or whatever. That itself (with a partner) is totaly worth a lot of Friday nights. Now that they are implementing items/loadouts into the game (or hats/taunts/clothes/flags to those who are uncertain of the term), the game will be more interesting. Now, I may not have many hours, but I assure you that I have beaten multi-player in about 4 hours, and the single player in 3. I mean, the rest of my hours come from exploring more/community maps. And that is the amazing thing about this game...no matter how many times you have beaten it, it is still fun. Also playing multi-player with a different friend every time makes you find a lot out about their creativity/teamwork/leadership/meatal abilities. ------------------------------- Other important things The many achievements with variety are also something to look on about. There are many things you will NEVER notice no matter how many times you play unless you YouTube some of it. The deeper you dig into the storyline, the more interesting you find the game. There were many rumors that we are still uncertain of, which makes this excellent.  To dumb it down: ------------------------------- Pros +Amazing graphics for a non-stop beautiful gameplay.  +Wonderful audio and music for a great experience.  +Well-designed maps and challenges.  +Unlimited maps (user-created).  +Fantastic story-line.  +Many users own this game. (Lol I remember the commercials).  +Holiday sales make buying this game super affordable. +Gender neutral. ++Helps with cognitive brain activity. ------------------------------- Cons -Limited story-line (I wish there was more to it, but there is always Portal 1).  -Some levels take seconds while others take many minutes. (Not really progressive difficulty wise in my opinion, which isn't a bad thing here .) -Limited campaign exploration. (Some repetitive looking levels here and there.)  -Restricted to the short story line. (However, there are some mods which are amazing, but if you want more, you have to manually download them instead of them being included with the game.) ------------------------------- My opinionated review I would say the cons are so minor that I shouldn't even have mentioned them because it may not make you buy the game. DO NOT let that happen. Get this game. I recommend buying during a sale to get Portal 1 and 2 for a cheap price together for the full experience (because they raised the price of this game recently). This is a classic game and will go down in history as one of the best - revolutionizing the way we think/game. It was such an amazing thought that I hope you guys consider for yourselves. ------------------------------- Rating Out of 100, there is nothing wrong with this game. You may not like it if you aren't creative, don't have friends to play it with, or can't appreciate an amazing \"Portal transportation\" concept. But listen, you will fall in love with this game and stack hours to it. There is no community to worry about other than wonderfully made maps from users like you. Definately get this game if you don't have it - that being said, my review shouldn't even matter. I would give this a  after all of that. I hope you read everything before looking at my rating. ------------------------------- Finally Thanks so much for reading, so I hope you share the love and rate this review up, as it took some thought to make. If you are still wondering whether you should get the game or not...well it always will be a must-have, and YES! Get it! ~thedubmark (I write reviews now :))","hours":26.3}

I'm still clueless how they set the bar for their prequel this high and even provided with a better sequel. I can't wait to jump into the co-op function honestly since the singleplayer was this good.  Valve literally took a look at Portal and said what could we improve towards the sequel. They added new general features like a loading screen, which I didn't find mandatory, and you can see where your portals are placed through walls. They stuck with similar ideas to complete their puzzles and added loads of new ways to solve puzzles and move along the map. Speaking of puzzles, they added so many, that it seems that the game is twice as long as the prequel. They added lasers and with them you have cubes which you can use to direct the lasers in any way you want. You have bouncing pads and on walls you see indicators which show where you land. You have bridges to guide you around the map. You also have floating pads which can work in two directions but only when triggered by a button. Finally you have three kinds of gel red blue and white. Red gel gives you a speed boost. Blue gel gives you a jumping boost and white gel allows you to portal on it, mainly for places that you couldn't portal on before.  Obviously the things previously said aren't the ones that baffled me but it is mainly the environment. The story is amazingly well built and it teaches us more about apeture sciences. It also contains a few plot twists here and there. The places you visit are fairly new but you'll visit some well remembered places from portal. Something they also introduced is companions, the most part of the game you'll have a object travelling with you. One of them is a funny little core with a british accent. Aside from entertaining you the bots can help you sometimes to get to certain paths. The jokes are as good as last game so expect a good laugh.  I highly recommend that you buy this game, and play it for the rest of the day or week. Turn off your notification, because the game doesn't support tabbing, and enjoy this gem for many and many times you want and are supposed to complete the story. (Edit:) You also can choose from many maps from the community to test out so you won't get tired of the story and you can still play.","hours":9}

That’s why success of the first part of the Portal was a surprise even for the VALVe. Therefore seriously question arose about the Portal 2. And what we got? Let's see.  　STILL ALIVE?  　　The game begins with the fact that Chell along with her new partner, personality module Wheatley, is trying to escape from an abandoned Aperture Science laboratory. Throughout the game, the plot makes a interesting twists. Individual deserves compliments perfect finale, after which there remain only a warm feeling. In Portal 2 no epic stories, huge explosions, incredible action, or the salvation of humanity. Instead, there is a charismatic characters, intelligent humor and interesting puzzles.  　ONE IS GOOD, BUT TWO IS BETTER  　　One of the achievements of the new Portal has been the emergence of the cooperative. Co-op story is a continuation of the plot of the single player. At first I thought that the only difference of the cooperative is the presence of two players with portal-guns, instead of one. In fact, the cooperative has unique ideas. Many puzzles solving quite differently. I advise you not to play cooperative with a random person (there is that possibility), and play it with a good friend.  　ENDLESS TESTS  　　In game was added a level editor, so anyone can create their own test chambers or try to play the levels of other players. To be honest, most of the player-created levels are too simple or ridiculous. But there is sufficient interesting maps (and some of them really hard). In no case do not miss the community maps.  　Multiplayer: 　　Online: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ  　　Co-op: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Storyline: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Graphics: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O 　Gameplay: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺  　  　Complexity of the achievements: All achievements can be easily earned (if you have good friend for the co-op) in the one-two walkthrough.  　　　　VALVe made another good 　　game.

It is crafted with superb empathy for the player's experience, regardless of gaming ability. The story, acting, music and world-building are impeccable.

There are some parts to the story where I genuinely felt threatened and isolated.   Graphics? Nothing to complain about.  Although Portal 2 is undoubtedly one of the best games I've played in a while, there are two errors that I find with it:  #1 There are parts in the game where you have to use the \"zoom\" key to find almost unfindable portable surfaces. I thought this gameplay mechanic was rather silly and annoying.  #2 There are parts in the game where the events that happen don't make much sense, and you wonder why you have to do certain things or why you're in certain places.

{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.848027487822292,"review":"Portal 2 takes elements of adventure, puzzle, platform and first-person action games and blends them into a unique genre mix. It builds on the foundation of its acclaimed predecessor, takes all the gameplay elements that made it great and vastly improves them in every aspect. With that said, I strongly recommend to play Portal first. If you don't you will still play through the sequel without any confusion, Portals plot was minimal (even though exceptionally well-written) and the basic puzzle design is picked up in Portal 2. But you would miss out on a great game and why would you want to do that?  Once again you take over Chell, Portals female protagonist, who finds herself rudely awakened from a cryogenic sleep and imprisoned in a small chamber inside the Aperture Science testing facility, an environment vaguely familiar from Portal - vaguely because a lot seems to have changed since your first time around. Some of the structures at the beginning of the game are indeed places you have already seen during your first escape but this time they are clearly aged, in a state of decay, overgrown with plants and seemingly abandoned. But soon you will have to make your way through unknown terrain and new test chambers that turn out to be anything but abandoned. Fans of Portal will be pleased to learn that GLaDOS makes its reappearance. Something else is different right from the start: You are now accompanied by a british-accented robot named Wheatley, who insists that an escape can only be accomplished together.  Portal 2 really shines in the writing department, the story is much more developed compared to the first installment. Many unanswered questions are revealed, such as bits and pieces of Aperture Sciences history and the origin of GLaDOS personality. Where GLaDOS was Portals only speaking character you now get to hear your goofy sidekick Wheatley and, through pre-recorded messages, Aperture Science founder Cave Johnson. All voice actors did an outstanding job and manage to really bring all three speaking characters to life.  If you played first-person shooters before you will be instantly familiar with the controls, mouse for camera movement, WASD to move, space to jump and left & right mouse buttons to shoot your portal gun. All game mechanics from Portal like pressure buttons, disintegration fields and of course the eponymous blue and orange portals, that are surprisingly simple in theory but make for surprisingly diverse and challenging puzzles, made it into the sequel and in addition many more are added: different sorts of gel that let you jump higher or run faster, catapults, light bridges, air tubes and lasers. Each element of its own already makes for complex puzzles but once the game starts to combine several of them you're in for a real challenge.  Compared to its predecessor, the game provides a lot more content. Not only is the single player campaign about twice as long, it even adds an extensive second co-op campaign. Two players open a lot more puzzle opportunities and the devs managed to use them to their fullest. But don't worry, you are given various means of communication. It's recommended to simply plugin your headset and make use of Steams voice chat feature but even if you don't you can still highlight spots by simply pressing a key, start countdowns to synchronize your actions, open a small screen that lets you look through the eyes of your co-op partner and perform small gestures to communicate non-verbally. Or you could just utilize the ingame chat to write.  But it doesn't end here. Thanks to user generated content the replayability is almost unlimited. When you mastered both campaigns, just tap into the huge library of player generated chambers, even whole campaigns are available to download, and keep playing with ever new challenges.  When you compare the visuals to Portal you cannot help but appreciate the excellent graphic design. While Portals test chambers looked bland and lifeless, they're now impoved with many small details. You have moving, transforming environments, plants growing through cracks in the walls and especially the vast, subterranean areas later in the game are a stunning sight.  Long story short: Portal 2 takes the premise of its predecessor and takes it to a whole new level. A game for the books.","hours":49.1}

In my opinion, this game adds a lot to the original formula and improves a lot of aspects of the first game, this time you'll have to breakout of a destroyed Aperture Science using your skills and your beloved portal gun. You'll also have to master 3 gels, the repulsion gel, the propulsion gel and the conversion gel.  The Story, along with the characters are pretty well written and they feel alive. The humor is well done and the dialogues, specially in the later scenarios are totally hilarious. Even you haven't played the first game, you'll undestand the story.  The aesthetics are beautiful and you'll have a lot of this so called screenshot opportunities, even if you have a low end rig, you'll be amazed of the beauty that can spawn from the source engine.  And the last but not less important aspect of the game, the soundtrack, from the first time you awake from your long time sleep to the last song, Is not only fitting, but also, like grabbing science and adapting it into an mp3 format.

My concern was whether or not they would manage to capture and continue the personality and sense of humor of the first game. I am very pleased to report that the sequel does not disappoint. The sequel pics up right where the first game left off, and GLaDOS holds a grudge. Her insults, passive aggressive comments, and general malice will have you chuckling throughout the game.

It boasts a longer, more diverse campaign that still manages to hold on to the humor, atmosphere, and overall quality that made the original so enjoyable. It also boasts a new cooperative mode, which brings the experience to a new level. And to top it off, with Steam Workshop integration, the possibilities for new content become limitless.  In the campaign, all of the strengths from the first game return and are fine-tuned to perfection. The puzzles are more diverse and interesting, with more advanced mechanics introduced. The atmosphere is even more fleshed out and enticing. The dialogue is even more hilarious and entertaining. And to top it all off, the game is about twice as long.  After that, there is also an incredibly well designed cooperative mode, complete with its own characters and puzzles. This adds what is effectively another whole game to the mix, which is a very welcome addition.  And to top it all off, with the Steam Workshop integration, there is endless possibilities for new puzzle rooms in both single-player and cooperative modes. Not all of it is great, of course, but some of it is arguably better than the real game. It is a gift that just keeps on giving.  With the gameplay being so intuitive and enjoyable, and the limitless possibilities of the Workshop, Portal 2 rockets to the clouds as a deity among video games. It is hands-down one of the absolute best games in existence. If you haven’t yet tried it, now is the time. There are hours of entertainment waiting for you.

Intentionally designed to be stupid British cores. Cruel women cores that are really good at singing. Turrets with low self esteem. A man that hates lemonade and sounds like J. Jonah Jameson from spiderman. A potato that becomes your friend.  Combined together with the one of the most original gameplay ever.  10/10","hours":11.2}

Portal was already incredible, yet somehow Valve managed to make the sequel exquisite.   Positive: - Fluid, responsive controls. - Amazing puzzles, both for single player and co-op. - Great difficulty curve. - This time there is actually a story. We finally get to learn more about Aperture Science. - Wheatley joins the party. In combination with GLaDOS, their unique personalities and humour just make Portal 2 incredible. Basically fantastic script and voice-acting. - This is not just a remake of Portal. This time gels are added to put a unique touch on puzzles. Basically an upgrade in gameplay and difficulty. - Co-op mode! Like single-player, the co-op mode is brilliantly designed, and addictively fun.  - Community-made maps (basically endless fun and challenges). - Companion cube still loves you <3  Negative: -  - You require a competent buddy for co-op.  Conclusion: Valve really outdid themselves this time. There really isn't much else to say. The praise I gave in my Portal review is just as valid here, although it must be said that Portal 2 deserves even more praise. You would be a fool not to play Portal and Portal 2.

At the beginning of Portal 2, Chell is awakened in a “long-term relaxation chamber” in Aperature Science by a little hilarious, British personality named Wheatley. Wheatley's goal is to help you escape, however you soon find out that GLaDOS is still alive. Chell is once again forced to use her portal gun to navigate the ruins of the facility and deal with the resurrected GLaDOS. The story takes some very interesting twists and turns along the way and the terrific dark humor of the first game remains intact. The gameplay from the original game returns in all of its mind-bending glory. Players use the portal gun to shoot blue and orange colored portal holes onto walls to traverse over deadly pits, transport Weighted Storage Cubes to switches to open doors and lower elevators and redirect lasers. Additions to the gameplay include the propulsion and repulsion gels which do pretty much as they describe, either sliding the player off at great speed or sending them bouncing high into the air. In addition, players must redirect light bridges and conveyer beams with portals as well. One of the most exciting new features in Portal 2 is the inclusion of co-op gameplay. Co-op gameplay gets its own storyline and characters, Aperture Science robots ATLAS and P-Body, each armed with their own portal gun and even more challenging puzzles for the gamers to solve. You can either play with a friend (split-screen or online) or team up with a random player. I highly recommend Portal 2 to anyone who is looking for a good fun game that will take up a few hours and even make you think instead of the average First Person Shooter.  Overall, Portal 2 is a masterpiece and definitely worth the money.

{"funny_percent":0.09183673469387756,"helpful_percent":0.9360037128071542,"review":"It goes without saying this is exceptionally one of the greatest first-person shooter games that doesn't require real bullets, competitive teamwork, accurate aiming, targets and most other common mechanics that are found in that specific genre to make such a fantastic and charming game. This title demonstrates what it always had shown in the prequel; perfect gameplay and immersive story-telling. Thus, this sequel opens the gateway to the remarkable Portal series.  Now, imagine all of those unanswered questions and obscure mysteries that linger within the first game, and how this sequel answers nearly all those said questions with the utmost scientific explanations through the lines of entertainment from this one. From what I could honestly tell you, this game took the first games mechanics, and widened the story much more bigger and exceptionally better. Portal 2 is by far, worthy of the 'Game of the Year 2011' awards.","hours":15.9}

I promised I'll catch him.  ... I lied.   I watch as he thunks and rolls on the ground.   He asks me to pick him up.   I refuse.   I watch as he entices, begs and cajoles me to pick him up.   Several minutes later I do.   Then he asks me to plug him into the wall.   I decide to dance around the room with him instead.   The cycle of begging and wheedling begins again.   After several minutes he gives up and falls silent.   I plug him into the wall.    10/10 Would torture Wheatley again.","hours":42.9}
