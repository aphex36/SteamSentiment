{"review":"Having played 28 hours of this game, I've decided to tell you why I think that this game is worth every cent. Obviously, It is absolutely imperative that you play the original game BEFORE playing this one.  Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is a game developed by Dennaton Games and published by Devolver Digital and serves as the sequel for Hotline Miami, a \"A hyper-violent top-down shooter/brawler\" and one of the most critically aclaimed indie games of all time. The game takes place after, during, and before the events of its predecessor and manages to maintain some of the frantic action that popularized the first game, HOWEVER, Wrong Number is much more story focused than the the original and serves as the developers way to tie up loose ends.  The gameplay retains certain aspects of from Hotline Miami but the levels are designed in such a way that you have to cower in fear behind each door and wait for the perfect moment so as to not get either snipped by a shotgun from across the map or spotted through a window. I, like most people, didnt enjoy this kind of level design, because there are enemies outside your camera's range who can react faster than you and end what seemed like a perfect run. One of the aspects the latter didnt retain from the former was the melee combat. In this game, melee combat was somewhat nerfed, making the melee swing slower and the and the range smaller.  One of the most controversial characteristics of Hotline Miami 2 is its relatively large cast of playble characters. But Haplop, how could more characters equal less fun. Well for starters you have more characters but less unique playstyles. There are 27 masks each with their unique gimmicks and playstyles opposed to the 14 characters of Hotline Miami 2. Whats more is that there most characters dont add anything new, here's whats new. Fists of Fury,(used by 2 different characters), lethal punches, cant pick up any weapons, wich renders it sorta useless since the levels are so big. Dodge Roll,(used by 2 different characters) you press space to dodge in the direction you are pointing and become invincible in the mean time, can sometime cause you to miss floor executions. Chainsaw and Guns,(unique) you control one of 2 sibllings wich (the one rocking the chainsaw), with your right mouse button you force the second sibling to shoot. The AI on the second sibling can be kinda buggy, and will sometimes become stuck behind walls while you charge inside a room full of mobsters armed to the teeth with nothing but a chainsaw. Two machine guns, (used by 2 different characters) you start with 2 smgs, you can have 64 bullets and can only reload once, after that, there is nothing special to it. Start with a nailgun,(unique)- 24 nails, silent killer, nothing out of the ordinary. Inner warrior,(unique) Fists of Fury with nunchucks. Remember the Richter and Aubrey mask from the previous game? They now grant no special abilities. There is also a character wich instead of killing can incapacitate and disarm foes for bonus points. You also get to play as a soldier wich can switch between a knife and one of for weapons ( a rifle, a shotgun, a sniper rifle and a flamethrower) but cant pickup any other weapons.  The soundtrack is just downright beautiful featuring the works of El Huervo, M|O|O|N, Perturbator and many other independent artists, it can go from slow and melancholic to full on assault in seconds and it really does not only live up to the standards set by the previous game but somehow also manages to surpass them by a pretty big stretch. Not only that but the audio in general is really descriptive and the mushy sound of grey matter splattering all over the room does add to the gory factor of the game, wich by the way, makes great use of the Hitchcock effect (google it) The sprites may seem a bit, how should I put it, wonky (?) at first but after playing through it you realize that it is one of the best way to convey to the player the setting of Miami's 1980's.   Overall the game in itself is great, the gameplay isnt as satisfying as that of the 1st game but the story is beautifully written. Its a much more down-to-earth game and the story always has you feeling sorrowful and melancholic while still keeping you interested and engaged as you watch this immensely dense plot unravel before your eyes while you cant really do anything about it. I guess that that is what really gives you a sense of accomplishment, once you manage to get the bigger picture that is. So...  Do you still like hurting other people?  Let me know if you agree with this review or not.","hours":42.6,"funny_percent":0.059233449477351915,"helpful_percent":0.9477351916376306}
{"review":"I feel the need to make an actual review for this game, because too many positive reviews for it are just memes and can be overshadowed by the more comprehensive negative reviews.  Hotline Miami can be tough to talk about, because Hotline Miami 1 was such a hit that this game will always be compared to it based on HM1's merits alone. The original game was about a masked serial killer who got mysterious phone calls threatening him into carrying out hits on mob locations. The whole story was pretty strange and trippy, with very little being what it seems. The gameplay was super fast and hectic as you ran around scavenging whatever you could find to beat the brains out of the army of mafia waiting in the buildings. The combat was close quarters-oriented with some enemies with guns, but mostly melee focused. Each mask had different abilities that affected your starting weapon, or gave you abilities like killing punches or spawning more guns as random pickups. All in all, it was a fairly good game with all of this.   The reason why I didn't really like Hotline Miami 1 was because the AI was actually fairly buggy and reacted either very sluggishly or hyper-quickly, without reason. The level design was very tight, and due to the ridiculous speed of everything, it felt too hard to control. I would finish a level and feel like I'd gotten lucky.  Hotline Miami 2 managed to fix a fair amount of the problems with the first. The combat is slowed down somewhat. Guns fire slower, melee weapons swing slower, and the level design is more open, allowing some more freedom of movement (the combo meter also lasts longer naturally). The result, in my opinion, is that the gameplay feels much more tight and controlled. The weapons swings feel like they have more weight to them, guns kill much more effectively, and the levels feel less restrictive. However, I've seen a lot of people say that they felt the opposite, and that they were driven more towards using guns because there are more enemies with guns, so melee is now useless. In the same vein, people hated the more open maps because they felt that there was a tendency to get shot from off-screen by an unseen enemy, or through glass.  I would say that Hotline Miami 2 is somewhat less casual than the first, which is why I think so many people feel that it's too hard. I bought both games together, and after I finished 1 I jumped straight into 2. The difficulty spike is noticable; it's been stated by the developers that it was primarily geared towards players who'd played the first game and knew how it worked. That being said, I didn't find it too hard to get into the groove of Hotline Miami 2. I died a ton at the start, and really all the way throughout, but it never felt like I had died due to BS game design, but rather my own mistakes or miscalculations. I think HM2 is meant to be played with a bit more planning in mind. You can rush in and fight, but it doesn't usually go well. However, it's also not like you need to plan your every move. You just need to observe enough that you know what you're about to get into. From there, it gets much easier. I said earlier that I felt like I'd gotten lucky when I'd finished a level in HM1. In HM2, I had felt quite the opposite. In each level, once I knew what I needed to do, I felt like I was much more in control. I finished levels and felt satisfied, without the tinge of anger or the \"I just got lucky that time\" feeling.  As for the gameplay problems: There are definitely more guns, and the gameplay is more gun oriented, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that melee play is impossible. To be honest, it felt the opposite in HM1; guns felt out of place, and, in many instances, rather ineffective. I feel like 2 strikes a better balance, even if it seems to favor guns more. Many levels still can be played with melee weapons, it just requires, as I said earlier, some more patience and planning. You just need to know what you're walking into.   As for the glass panes and off-screen deaths: I've encountered the first, but not the second. There are, once again, more glass panes for enemies to shoot you through that in HM1, but that is always a two-way street: You can just as easily shoot them better as well. As for the off screen deaths, I have almost never, at any moment in HM2, died to an enemy that I COULDN'T have been able to see. What do I mean by this? Well, the camera obviously places the most emphasis on the direction you're facing or trying to look. Whenever I've been killed by an \"off-screen enemy\", I've really just been killed by one that I couldn't see because I was looking the wrong way, in a sense. It's easier to notice if you look at gameplay of it. The only exception to this are the crouching gun enemies which pop up when the player is in their line of sight, becuase they have a huge sight range for some reason. They alone are the enemies that can kill you before you can see them. I think all of the other enemies have about the same ( or a bit less) of the sight range of the player.   What about the more open maps? Well, I'm mixed. Some maps are straight up huge, but they actually aren't that hard to traverse and fight through. Others, particulary Hard News, Blood Money, and Takeover, are unforgivably open, and cannot be played easily without guns (or really at all for Blood Money). But otherwise, as big as some maps are, you can still play through them using melee. Act 5 in particular is a sort of throwback to HM1's more frantic style with somewhat more restricted maps and lots of melee enemies.  The story of HM2 is also something that some players don't like. I don't want to go into it, because there are some big spoilers, but I will say this: HM2's story is far more lucid than HM1's. It's told in a style which constantly switches characters, which is why it seems harder to comprehend, but it's actually fairly easy to piece together if you're observant. Several characters have stories that directly link to HM1, as the story is anachronistic (is that the word?) and takes place before, after, and during the events of HM1.  As for the character abilities: HM2 is definitely more restrictive in playstyles than HM1 in some instances. Few characters/factions have the option of different abilities, but those few abilities that do exist are all very unique and varied. There's one character that can do a dodge roll, another can carry two SMGs. Yet another disarms all the guns he picks up, making him more melee based (see?) but can go rage mode if you kill enemies instead of knocking them out. Some characters have no abilities, and those are personally my favorite, because they have the most open and unrestriced gameplay (as some characters are stupidly restrictive, such as the Fans). The soundtrack also rocks, because it's less ambient than the HM1's. In HM2, the soundtrack carries far more weight and fits the scene better, and is never repetitive.  So that's basically all about Hotline Miami 2 (thanks for sticking around this long). To be honest, The best way to experience this game is to buy it with the first as a combo pack (it only adds $5 to the price of just HM2). That way, you can play both games, experience both playstyles, develop your own opinions, be better prepared for the challenge of Hotline Miami 2, and better appreciate the overall story (which is actually really interesting). That's basically all I have to offer.","hours":234,"funny_percent":0.01652892561983471,"helpful_percent":0.9628099173553719}

{"review":"Hotline Miami 2 is closer to the last levels of the first game (Biker) than the rest of Hotline Miami (Jacket and all his masks), and thus feels like a direct continuation rather than just a new coat of paint. This opinion might seem a bit obtuse now, but I will explain later on why it is an important distinction.  So, why is it a continuation rather than a new take?  Well, at first, the difficulty is brutal right off the bat. This game is aimed at people who already played Hotline Miami 1 and are familiar with the concept of its ultra-violent twitch gameplay associated with tight level design forcing the players to plan their route according to the situations.   And then, the playable characters are mostly forced, just like Biker was, and they have an equally narrow skillset. Biker had a hatchet and three knives to throw but could not pick up weapons? Tony from Hotline Miami 2 has his insta-kill fists but is unable to pick up weapons.  The game moved on from the freedom of choice offered in the majority of Hotline Miami 1, and forces a more controlled experience. This idea goes further, as a lot of levels are designed so tightly that the chaotic action of Hotline Miami 1 has been replaced by puzzles with barely more than one way to solve them.   Moreover, the gameplay is overall less rough around the edges, with more solid surfaces that block bullets, and most especially a seemingly slower speed, I feel more like I have to anticipate every movement rather than play on the fly and let my instincts and skills take over. More 'slow', less 'flow'.  So here I come to the point that I made at the start: Hotline Miami 2 feels like a more controlled experience as a direct continuation to the Biker levels, rather than the early levels with their chaotic sandbox design that allowed for a much wider variety of approaches.   However, enough Hotline Miami 2 levels are not so tight and can offer variety, and a lot of missions offer a choice between different characters or weapons. So the game still does a good job at offering variety. My observation is just that the variety feels forced, rather than the sweet spot and perfect flow that I felt Hotline Miami 1 achieved.  Hotline Miami 2 is more polished that the first one. Way more polished. The levels, atmosphere, sounds/music and storylines have all been crafted with great attention to details and take the player on several journeys that make this sequel well worth playing. The game definitively feels fresh and ambitious rather than 'more of the same', and its controlled chaos makes the first Hotline Miami still relevant with its less polished but more chaotic and free ultra-violence.","hours":41.4,"funny_percent":0.03296703296703297,"helpful_percent":0.8791208791208791}

{"review":"Hotline Miami 2 is neither a step forward or a step back when compared to its legendary original. It is in some ways better than the first and in some ways worse. It is really up to the player to determine if it is as up to par or even better than the first. I'll sum it up quickly in a PROS and CONS list.  PROS   - Amazing soundtrack as usual. Not as iconic as the first but definitely more versatile.  - Slick retro graphics that are slightly improved and more vivid than the first. Soldier's missions also throw in a more hazy variety. And the last level...prepare yourself. - Cleverly written and delivered story that isn't shoved down your throat. In some ways it is open to interpretation, but it is more focused and clear than the original's narrative. - Interesting and engaging characters...whether you hate them or not (screw Manny Pardo though. You'll know why once you play the game).  - Core gameplay itself is as slick as ever. Nothing new as the system was good to begin with. - Upcoming level editor for near endless replayability and experimentation.  - GOTTA GET A GRIP!  CONS - Some levels have very annoying level design with an abundance of windows. Level design is NOT the same as Hotline Miami. It is one of the key break-offs and differences actually. Maps are significantly bigger and that is bittersweet. You will die a lot more times by a goon with a gun off-screen that you couldn't see. This may also be because of slightly smarter AI and I believe field of vision. - Lackluster hard mode. The hard mode is filled with artificial difficulty to the point where it could be viewed as unfair. With the already larger maps, adding in even more windows is frustrating.  - Smooth gameplay experienced from the first can be notably delayed and interrupted because of the level design/hard mode (or both) in some levels.   NEUTRAL - No more iconic mask catalog like you oh so loved in the first game. Instead, you have different characters with different abilities and playstyles depending on the chapter you are playing. The Fans are a group that have masks that each have their own unique ability, such as dual submachine guns, combat roll, or Tony's lethal punches. There's also the budget Batman known as The Writer, and The Soldier, who permanently wields a gun that can have refillable ammo on drops and a combat knife. These characters change how you play the game completely, instead of just perks like the masks in the first game. However, it really depends on what you like. The game is different because of this.    Overall, I personally loved this game. It is one of my favorites, period. I can't decide if I like it more than the first, but I'm definitely pouring more hours into it. I don't believe it SHOULD be compared to the first, but obviously that's inevitable seeing how legendary the first installment is. If you are a fan of the series, I definitely recommend this game. If you liked the first purely for the gameplay, you may be disappointed here as it is different in many ways.   9/10","hours":68.4,"funny_percent":0.043859649122807015,"helpful_percent":0.868421052631579}
{"review":"I'd like to preface this review with a warning to anyone who hasn't played the first Hotline Miami: play that one first. Hotline Miami 2's story and difficulty assumes you've done so. There are other, more critical reasons as well, but I'll touch on that later. This review will be written with those who have played it in mind, but there will be no spoilers for either game.  Intro Holy heck, it's finally here! After two long years and much angst, Hotline Miami 2 is finally on Steam, with new characters, levels, and more groovy tunes than you can shake a bloodied bat at. There's also a semblance of story this time, which is both exciting and slightly worrying: after all, wasn't part of the fun of the first game putting the soggy cardboard puzzle peices together? After about 10 hours marathoning through it all, I'm ready to give the verdict on whether or not Hotline Miami 2 is a worthy successor to the original cult classic.  Story \"Author, you Naughty Dog, why are you focusing on story first, rather than gameplay?\" The answer is pretty simple: the inclusion of an actual story this time means that the gameplay scenarios are more tailored and guided than before. That being said, that doesn't mean the story is any good. The variety of characters and subplots is impressive in its own right, but only two of the many characters get an actual conclusion, while the other's stories just seem to... evaporate. The game ended so suddenly my jaw dropped - not because of any plot twists, but because the ending was so frying-pan-to-the-face abrupt. I'll give credit to Dennaton for creating some very interesting characters to follow, but again, little is done with most of them.   Even with the actual story being mediocre, the thematic elements are interesting when dissected. Much like the first game, HM2's story benefits from discussion, as there are plenty of details that can be missed and multiple interpretations to follow. Without giving away much, the plot feels very much like a yin to the first game's yang, and can even be sobering at times. While it certainly isn't portrayed the most spectacularly, it's clear that plenty of effort was put into the story's themes, and that can certainly be appreciated.  Gameplay Suprise suprise, the nitty gritty of the gameplay isn't that different from its predicessor. What is different is how abilities are handled: instead of playing as one character with a vast swarth of masks to choose from, HM2 switches from character to character depending on the level, due in part to the aformentioned narrative. The variety and swapping between narratives is fun from a purely gameplay standpoint, as each character has their own interesting twists on how they play, and the screentime between characters never feels too condensed or drawn out.   Unlocks are also changed. Instead of simply unlocking masks, beating levels unlocks specific items for the character, or in the case of the Fans, characters. There are no replay-oriented objectives to do to acquire these items; by the time the game ends, all the items will be unlocked.  Level Design Yes, this is getting its own subsection, simply because of how utterly broken the levels become. Besides the fact that there is very little of a difficulty curve (it's more akin to a very steep line), many of the levels are simply too big, rely on scummy techniques to complete, and force very specific, counterintuitive playstyles. Because some levels are so open, moving cautiously and usage of the SHIFT zoom are outright required, lest an enemy shoots at you offscreen. Most of the levels REQUIRE you to use a gun because of how spread out and well-armed the enemies are. Very often there is little choice but to use the \"peekaboo\" tactic, baiting enemies out of their locations to have them run into your preferred melee weapon. Often times, completing levels feels more like a chore than an accomplishment. It's so bad, I can't bring myself to start the game again - this is coming from a guy who HAD to find out the full story in the first game.   These wouldn't be so terrible if the first Hotline Miami didn't do level design and player agency within it's level so well. As it stands, these are baffling designs that Dennaton should have perfected by now.   Music A great compilation of familiar and new artists. Even if some of the levels haphazardly enforce a slower pace, the music selection works well, for the most part. It's not purely bombastic music during gameplay this time around (not that there's anything wrong with bombastic music); depending on the character, his motifs, and the overall setting of the scene, the soundtrack can be very versatile - its not pure adrenaline all the time, like Jacket from the first game. My only complaint is that due to the new variety of songs, the soundtrack seems less focused than before; I guess going from 22 tracks from the first game to a whopping 49 tracks will inevitably cause some trail-off.  Conclusion I think it's important to treat Hotline Miami 2 as less of a sequel and more of a stand-alone expansion. After all, most if not all of the ideas for this game stemmed from DLC ideas from the first. There's a certain charm in playing with ideas that developers once had on their \"MAYBIE?\" section of their office whiteboard. The story is structured as a companion to the first game rather than a continuation. Overall, Hotline Miami 2 is a glass of wine that goes well with a bourbon steak; a wonderful compliment to the flavor of the main course, but not really something to be enjoyed purely on it's own.","hours":17.4,"funny_percent":0.03773584905660377,"helpful_percent":0.7987421383647799}

{"review":"\"Welcome to the Salty Spatoon. How tough are ya?\"  \"How tough am I? I beat Hotline Miami 2.\"  \"So.\"  \"On Hard Difficulty\"  \"Step right in\"   In all seriousness this is just more Hotline Miami just with much larger and more annoying levels. You will be killed by: enemies that are off screen, your character not picking a loaded weapon insted picking up a small knife, the gun not firing because its stuck in a wall, pressing space not executing the downed foe infront of you and various other cheap deaths. However that being said, this game is just just as violent and satisfying as the first. It's not as good as the first overall, but still good. The sound track is excellent and the story does conclude in such a way that there's probably not going to be another game in the series. Just don't play the hard mode if you don't like cheap deaths. If you liked the first game then I would say play this game as soon as possible. If you haven't played the first game (seriously get the first game its dirt cheap when on sale and still quite cheap when not), its hard for me to recommend this game at full price wait till a sale if possible.

{"review":"Hotline Miami 2 is the highly anticipated sequel to Hotline Miami (duh). Hotline Miami (which from now on I will call hlm because thats easier to type out) is a crazy top down shooter with a super dope soundtrack. It's filled with violence and moments that leave you just in awe. HLM2 has lots positives and negatives and I feel that the easiest way for me to do this review is if I split this into a list of Pos/Negs and then give my final word on the game.  Positive Soundtrack The music in this game actually manages to improve on the first game's. The songs get you super pumped up and ready to blow heads off or get you feeling mellow and make you reflect upon the bloodbath you just caused. I really reccomend you buy the soundtrack here. Weapon variety There are a load of new guns and melees for you to try to murder someone with. The guns are a welcome change, the gun play is sorta refreshing now, because it feels like there is an actual variety in what gun to use. Story Some people may not like the story, but personally I really enjoyed the way that they did the story. There was backstory to HLM1 and it showed the world after the events of HLM1 too. I won't spoil anything but the ending is definitely going to annoy a lot of people but personally I thought it was a great way to end off the game.  Negative Level Design You probably expected me to complain about this because frankly everyone has. The levels are way too big and open which would be only half as bad if the levels also werent littered with windows and it is very very annoying to get sniped from some butthead across the level. \"Hide and Seek\" The game has basically become playing hide and seek in order to clear levels due to the size and windows leaving you out in the open and vulnerable to be shot by someone you cannot see. Soldier levels The soldier levels are honestly one of the most unfun levels in the game due to being limited to one gun and knife the whole time and having to refill your ammo only to get half the normal amount of ammo. It leads to you camping the nearest ammo bin and just luring people to you.  Hotline Miami 2 is a game for the diehard fans of the first game who want a conclusion to the story and are willing to deal with the new style of play in this game in order to recieve the conclusion they dearly wanted. If you're not a fan of 1 or don't really want to play the story I'd reccomend you stay away unless you're excited for the level editor that's soon coming and want to play community creations.","hours":14.3,"funny_percent":0.125,"helpful_percent":0.8645833333333334}

{"review":"Hotline Miami 2 is a difficult game to recommend, because it's only going to appeal to a certain group of people. Not to mention, the base game has changed a decent amount since its release in March 2015. As of now, I would recommend Hotline Miami 2 to fans of the first game and twin stick shooters, but the game itself is pretty hit-and-miss.  The story of Hotline Miami 2 is polarizing, to put it lightly. You'll probably have a different opinion on it than any of the critics or players you find after finishing the game. I've got mixed feelings on it. Its structure, where you play as characters before and after the events of the first game and an overall plot slowly forms, is really innovative and allows for some cool set pieces. However, due to the narrative being split between a dozen or so characters, there isn't much in the way of development or growth for anyone, so it's hard to feel connected to your character before he or she gets their brains blasted out.  The gameplay has improvements over the first game and questionable changes. Guns are now more viable and frequent, and every bullet will deal a one-hit kill to regular enemies instead of the RNG of the first game. There are more factions to fight and more weapons to choose from (though not everything from Hotline Miami 1 makes a return). Unfortunately, melee weapons got a severe nerf. For some reasons, melee swings are much slower, and most executions are drastically slower than in the first game. Expect to die frequently because you executed an enemy while another wandered into the room. You'll be desperately mashing the attack button and getting killed often, aside from a few fast executions for certain characters.  The soundtrack is fantastic. Regardless of how you feel about the game, you'll want to buy the soundtrack after you play through it. It's heavier and darker than the first game's, and has a more diverse selection of artists. Musicians like Perturbator and Jasper Byrne return, and newcomers like Carpenter Brut and Benny Smiles bring their own unique styles to the game.  If there's one standout reason I would recommend the game, it would be the level editor. Though it may not be perfect or even complete, the level editor allows the user to right some of the wrongs from the story's level design and create their own single levels and campaigns. With Steam Workshop and sprite modding support, one can feasibly make the Hotline Miami 3 of their own desires. Or, if you don't take it too seriously, you can create comedic levels with rapid-fire dialogue and intentionally-crappy designs.  The degree to which I would recommend this game depends on how much you liked the original. If you thought it was alright, I would skip Hotline Miami 2. If you liked it and wanted more, I would recommend buying this on sale and skipping over to the level editor once the story mode becomes unbearable. If you honestly, truly loved the first game and analyzed every detail of it, I would suggest buying it at full price and plowing through the complete story. At the very least, the final level's spectacular presentation and attention to detail make up for the lackluster fifth and sixth acts of the game.","hours":814,"funny_percent":0.05,"helpful_percent":0.9333333333333333}

{"review":"A few days ago, I started to play Hotline Miami, it was an amazing experience and I was looking forward to the second game.  First impressions were pretty good. HM2 is more colorful, visually improved, added some weather effects, breakable objects and more gore + more variety in level design.   But then I encountered a \"thing\" that I didn't experience in the first game. This \"thing\" is called - f*cking game breaking bug. It's not a big deal if you get it on the first level, but when you are on a mission that takes 20-30 minutes to complete - it really leaves a bad taste. There is always a possibility to get teleported outside of the house when you use the stairs. Once I teleported into some kind of a fence and couldn't move my character anymore. Had to restart the mission. Sometimes you can shoot enemies through walls, which should not be possible. Sometimes dogs get stuck and start to whirl like tornadoes. There are a lot of similar visual and pathfinding bugs throughout the game.  I really dislike that there is no indicator where to go when you complete a level. You mostly have to backtrack using your own memory.  HM2 has far less masks, but it has more unique characters with unique abilities, so it evens out a little bit.  I feel that the core gameplay has slightly regressed. Item variation has decreased. Mission maps got bigger and longer. Sometimes you need only 2-4 minutes to complete a level, other times it can take 20-30 minutes. I think that the first Hotline Miami did a better job with level design. It was visually less varied, but just felt better and was more fun to replay them.  HM2 has an unique storytelling. It feels inconsistent, disjointed and doesn't make sense up until the very last missions. Most of the time you are in a \"WTF?\" state. I kinda liked it and disliked it at the same time.  Overall, I think that the first HM game was more straightforward, more concentrated and more polished, but that doesn't mean that HM2 is a bad game. It's still very good, but could have been a little bit better.  Oh and you can create levels with the level editor! Pretty neat.","hours":18.9,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":1}

{"review":"I recommend Hotline Miami 2. But let me start with the not so well executed parts of this game:  Space around alot of obstacles imply you could walk around them, but blocking your way with collision instead. Limited character selection in combination with the sometimes linear level design makes it frustrating to complete a stage, giving you less options to approach a level. While some characters and their abilities make it easy to go through a stage, some other loadouts can completely frustrate the player. Gladly there is a 'rewind' option.  On the other hand, the way they wrapped up the story expecially with the well selected soundtrack (once again) and the new character selection is top-notch. Makes you want to complete it twice because you didn't get the ending!  Some reviewers mind the look-further function which snaps weirdly. I agree, but must say: Use it wisely. No need to downgrade due to a minor detail that you can surely work-around to enjoy the game.  They added a new snap function, which allows you to snap to enemies even if they are not inside your field of view. In addition I also enjoy the ability to sort of explore the character by finding out what his or her secondary ability is and how to play the character in the best possible way.  I'd also like to mention that small 'puzzle' elements, e.g. 'how do I get to this gun to kill these bodyguards?' are HIGHLY satisfying. Or picking up the only gun behind a door to mow down 7 mobsters who rush toward you shortly after. Another example is using a sniper rifle in an open level, which is amazingly satisfying as well and breaks the usual very hard gameplay up a little.  To sum up: Killing people is a simple job, but who said it will be easy? You will swear and cheer and retry. You will have your frustrating moments, and the AI is very unforgiving and fast. There is a harder difficulty as well for people who will actually see that murdering people isn't that bad.  Do I recommend it? Absolutely.  Oh, and around 50 songs used are in this game. Grab the soundtrack!","hours":11.7,"funny_percent":0.04310344827586207,"helpful_percent":0.7241379310344828}

{"review":"THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HOTLINE MIAMI 1 AND 2  I just beat the game so I'll try to tell you. HM2 is bloodier, and it's much harder. However, I think it's harder due to poor level design. The best way to put it is most of the levels are like the really hard floor in the chapter \"Hot & Heavy\" (you know the one). Most levels have long corridors and lots of windows, so most of the time you won't know there's an enemy till it's too late.   HM2 has a much more complex storyline, as it involves around a dozen playable characters, and I'm considering playing through it multiple times just to understand it.  My main gripe is that there is much less unlockable content in this game. HM had tons of weapons and masks that you could use on EVERY LEVEL. HM2 has around 10 unlockable masks and 3 unlockable weapons that you can use on certain levels. You could argue that the new masks are cool, quality over quantity and all that, but I think there should've been more masks.  However, whether you should buy Hotline Miami 2 all depends on ONE THING. How in-depth is the level editor? That level editor can easily make or break the game for me. Can you imagine playing a recreation of Doom, with a custom Doom Guy mask?  In conclusion, if you REALLY need more Hotline Miami, you should get this game. It's no where near as good as the first one, but it's still pretty good I guess. If you really don't want to risk your money on this, wait for the level editor to come out, and then see what people think of the level editor. It should be out sometime this spring.","hours":13.7,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.759493670886076}
