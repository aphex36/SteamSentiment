Gmod has a server running it.  Perhaps you want to play a RTS? Maybe a murder mystery game? Hide and seek? Racing? Yup, Gmod has it all.

Its also uses the same format as Half Life 2 I guess. :D The game consists of many gamemodes that people play on. Popular ones like DarkRP and Trouble in Terrorist Town are filled with people on most servers, and there are many more gamemodes that are filled too!  I mainly started playing this game in early 2014 digging through certain gamemodes that I liked, and the one that interested me was DarkRP. I joined a community that was filled with a whole bunch of fantastic people! Yea there were some people who were rude and mean, but others were caring and nice. During that year, I eventually met people who would soon become my friends. That made Gmod worth playing and so I put 2 summers into it.   I would defenitely recommend this game to people because of how much fun it is. The downside is that you need Counter Strike Source to fix the missing textures. But hey, overall the game is pretty enjoyable. Its on sale for the Steam Summer Sale so why not give it a try, right? Thanks for reading!","hours":1605.5}

I was looking for a game that could spark my interests, and when i got Garrys mod i was NOT disapointed. It was able to get my creative juices flowing again as i explored the many tools and addons to make Screenshots. It didnt just make me learn HOW to make screenshots, but also how to improve my creative skills, doing things no one else could and discovering my love of making artwork again.  The one thing i REALLY love about GM, is that its not restricted to just one thing. The many available gamemodes were able to allow myself to truly enjoy gameplay and not get so easily bored like i had with other games. Weather it was doing them alone or with friends i always ended up having a good time.  Another good thing are the game servers themselves, from TTT, Prophunt or good old sandbox i can tell you there are some GREAT servers with good people to make you feel welcome.  and finally, the price. I did NOT regret the money i spent on buying Garrys mod. if im honest its a perfect price to something that has endless and growing possibilties!   So, give it a try yourself!","hours":3540.1}

But then I had a revalation. A eureka moment, of sorts. At first, I joined a MilitaryRp server, waited 10 minutes to be trained, then left.  It wasn't fun.  I got bored so I decided to join and troll a dark \"rp\" server (heavy quotes on rp) just to laugh at all the bad servers. I joined, picked the dog job the server had, walked up behind someone, and said as loudly as I could \"OMAE WA MO SHINDERU\" and started attacking him. This turned into 10 minutes of role-playing as a edgy anime character, ending with a final duel between me and the guy I tried to kill. He pulled out his ultimate werewolf form and defeated me.   It was fun.  This is what made me realize what garry's mod is, and why it's fun. Garry's mod isn't really a serious game. It's not meant to be taken seriously. I mean, look at the store pictures for it. Doesn't it just shout \"serious military roleplay\"? When you take garry's mod, and try to bring seriousness to it, it's hard. Take the MilitaryRp server, for example. Why did I even need to be trained? I've played those servers before, and they ALL make you go through training. All they teach you are meaningless boring stuff, like ranks, faces, and other things that you probably never use.  When you try to make this game a slog of rules, it just ruins it.   This game shines when silly stuff happens, and is encouraged. You can do some weird stuff too.  Try it.  See what weird stuff you can come up with.  Never be serious.","hours":513.9}

I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.  \"Where do I start?\" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...  _The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.  _Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.  _Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.  _Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.  _My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.   Gameplay: 9/10 Graphics: 7/10 Story: N/A Sound: 8/10 Replayability: 10/10  Overall 8.5  Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy...

{"funny_percent":0.13414634146341464,"helpful_percent":0.731151890143326,"review":"This probably has to be one of my favorite video games of all time, simply because of the growing community/community content, and the limitless amount of things you can do in this game.  If you don't like reading, here's the pros and cons I listed off : Pros : -You can create anything you can come up with. (With some time and skill.) -A huge workshop that has millions of addons and mods that you can download with a push of a button. -Gamemodes that give a new experience. -HUGE community that is still growing, and creating new content. -New P2P option, where port-fowarding isn't needed, and all mods are available from the start. -Thousands of videos made with GMOD. -Tons of fantastic animations made with GMOD, that sometimes can have really high quality, and great humor. -Some mods are really well made, and are very useful for certain things. -Addons that can customize the menus of the game. -Mac ports have a slight graphical downgrade, which reduces crashing, and other graphical bugs. -More Pros that I don't have, because this game's community is really big.  Cons : -Making Mods and Addons like ragdolls and NPCs is extremely difficult for newcomers to the source engine. -Crashes every now and then, especially when there's a ton of stuff that you've made. -Some mods are effortless, stolen, or clickbait-y. -Game is best around PC, so Macs have some features not available to them, and they have a slight graphical downgrade. -More Cons that I don't have, because this game's community is really big.  When Garry's Mod says it's a Sandbox game, it really means it. You can actually do anything you can put your mind to. You can create functional machines, you can create wacky scenes with props, and so much more! It's really fun to just mess around with certain things. Another thing is the workshop, which is what makes this game a lot more fun! The workshop allows you to download addons and mods from different people with just a push of a button (With exceptions such as dupes and saves.) This is great, because other games have a difficult process of installing the mods, and it really takes a ton of knowledge, and time.  However, creating mods is something different. While creating dupes and saves are easy as cake, creating addons such as ragdolls, npcs, functional entities, props, gamemodes, and others require a ton of source knowledge, and time. That's my only real problem with this game. Making your own models, and putting them into GMOD can be difficult to someone who doesn't know the source engine well. Gamemodes are also a big part in this game. While I like to stick to the default \"Sandbox\" gamemode, there are tons of other gamemodes that can really change the game. And you can find many gamemodes on the workshop as well! Another problem that I have with this game is the crashing. It's really frustrating when you create something really great, and the game crashes on you, like it's throwing your work in the trash. But this isn't a really big problem, because you eventually get used to everything, and learn how to save your progress on something. The community is big, and is still growing today. There's countless videos and animations being made with GMod, and some can be really well made. Of course, there's gameplay videos around the internet, but I personally think the GMod animations need a spotlight. (And not just because I am a GMod animator myself.) There are really nicely made animations that sometimes even beat the quality of some Source FilmMaker animations. And they added this new P2P option, where you don't have to port-foward, or anything like that! They made it a lot easier to make different servers, and every mod that you have that the host has is available! Now you can play with friends without most of the confusing server stuff.  Overall, this game is a fantastic \"must-have\" Sandbox game that takes creativity to an extreme, and is a lot of fun to play with friends. Definitely reccomending this game.  I'm sorry if I said something that isn't accurate, or isn't well said. This is one of my first reviews.","hours":5540.1}

Sometimes Zombie Survival is also a whole bunch of players teaming up against computer controlled zombies as well.), Prop Hunt (A few seekers are chosen, and the rest of the players are disguised as props and must find strategic places to hide in order to avoid being caught. Seekers win by finding all props, Props win by successfully staying hidden until time runs out.), and many other epic minigames. Not to mention, this game is really good for creating animations and learning anatomy of the body. Unfortunately, the community of this game is AIDS, but hey, everything else is cool, so that basically evens this game out to a positive review. Good day. :)","hours":888}

If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it. Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh).  There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers.  A great game with a good community if you know where to look.","hours":1019.6}

Do you want a house that doesn't care about gravity? Go ahead! A car that can go at lightning-speed and crash against a wall in a split second? Of course! What about a roller coaster? heh, that too!  We give you the tools, and you build whatever you want! Or you can just screw around throwing things in the air and kill NPCs in single-player.  Gmod also benefits from a rich amount of content made by the community! There's a HUGE amount of addons made by the community, a huge array of stuff to play with. A variety of gamemodes to play with friends, tons of maps to explore and screw around with, props that you can use for a scene of yours, weapons to shoot with, hell even tools that can make your life easier in sandbox!  Multi-player is where the true madness lies at, TTT being a game of deception, HnS a game about outsmarting your friends while avoiding them, Sandbox where you can show off your building skills.  No way to win but no way to lose; Gmod is a sandbox game where you can pretty much do anything you desire.","hours":1075.5}

The perfect exemple of a \"sandbox\" game, the only limit is your imagination. More than that, Garry's mod (or Gmod for intimates) is a game that hosts games named \"gamemodes\" (wich adds fun). One inconvenience : models and textures. Those from Counter-strike: Source are indispensable. Except this disadvantage, I strongly recommend this game. Its price is low for what the game can gives you.","hours":3321.1}

There is many game modes you can play in and discover all kinds of ways to have fun. Sandbox was the first game mode I ever played in. Sandbox may be the most amazing game mode because you get to download pretty much anything like weapons, props, player models, places/maps other game modes exc. Anything you can think of you can get in the game and spawn it to create anything you want. You can create scenes with characters and objects and have them do anything. You can creat worlds too. You can be anything in the game as far as any character you can think of even objects. You can spawn good guys bad guys and have them fight including you. You can prank, be funny, joke and fool around, roll play or even vs each other. You can even come up with your own ideas to play sandbox. For example two of my friends and I were in sandbox and two of us were giants and one of us was tiny, so we had to find the tiny guy and kill him in order to win, so that's a idea to come up with to have fun. Like I said use your imagination and come up with all kinds of ideas to have fun with and I do repeat you can do anything in sandbox which sums up this whole review. One more thing. Garry's Mod Murder game mode is my favorite because it's basic and easy. All I got to say is some has gun some has knife some has nothing. All u gotta do is survive. If ur the murder kill everyone, if u have the gun kill the murders and if you have nothing u can get 5 props to get a gun or pick up a gun if somebody with it dies or u can simply explore or just escape the murders. Murder is interesting because you don't know who the killers are till you see them or if you see them and same with the players with the gun you just don't know what to expect or what the outcome will be when the round is over.The most I like about Garry's Mod is all the kinds of people you can meet and become friends with. We can all have great amazing times together and learn from each other. It's like having adventures.","hours":2320.7}

Garrys Mod is an amazing game with a good amount of gamemodes and lovely servers. You may want to play Sandbox and smack around batman or play TTT and rage because you were rdmed.  Gameplay   Garrys mod does not have a specific type of gameplay ranging from Prop Hunt to Stop It Slender. However your gameplay can be significantly improved by using the steam workshop and adding items.  Mods  Garrys mod is a game focused upon the premise of random and fun addons. I personally enjoy being a watermelon and firing pizzas from a bazooka. Garrys mod has an amazing amount of mods including characters and items. This is a game focused around its modding community.  TTT (Trouble In Terrorist Town)  TTT is the most famous gamemode in Garrys Mod. The premise of the game is simple. At the begining you are assigned a role, you are either an innocent bystander, a detective, or a traitor. However do not worry if you are innocent for this is trouble in terrorist town meaning everybody had guns. The innocent and the detectives try to find out who the traitors are while the traitors try to kill them all off. The gamemode is fun and server usually will have cool player models or gun. The main downside with TTT is rdmer's. RDM stand for Random Death Match and an rdmer is someone who out of the blue will try to kill you. This means an inno/detective randomly kills an inno/detective or a traitor kills an traitor or an inno just randomly kills someone who is a T. This really spoil's the gamemode making it unenjoyable at times but usually admins or mods will be on to help you or they will have an option to directly report it to kick/ban the person.   Sandbox  Sandbox is where creativity and stupidity flourish. Sandbox is where you can get all your downloaded mods and just have fun. Sandbox is just fooling around and having fun. It is one of Garrys Mod most hilarious game modes (if you play with the right people).  Singleplayer/Muliplayer  So if your planning on playing Sandbox I would recommend playing singleplayer or creating a hamachi or another program to play with a select group of friends,  If you plan to play other gamemodes I suggest playing multiplayer and trying to find a nice server which you can enjoy.  Rating  Pros\t + fun alone or with friends + many gamemodes to enjoy + massive amount of creative and fun mods + overall great community + highly enjoyable   Cons\t - rdmers - will end up overloading computer with mods  Final Thoughts  Garrys Mod is a must buy with its countless possibilities. It may take you a while to find a nice server or the gamemode that is for you but when you find it good times will be waiting. The mods are just so amazing that I salute all the mod makers for their effort and allowing me to become a watermelon with a portal gun.","hours":214.4}
