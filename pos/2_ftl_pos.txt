Just before it broke, my crew member came back under my control, long enough to allow the weapon to fire one last time. My missle hit half a second before the rebel flagship salvo slammed into my ship. It was enough. My ship and the rebel flag both exploded simultaneously as the credits of victory started up.

I had to work the next day, but found myself playing this....game....until 4am.  After spending >100 hours (it’s sad, I admit) on this game, you start realising little things:  If you destroy a system, its ‘hit points’ is at zero. But if you cause a hull breach, you can effectively make a system’s hit points go below zero (since you have to repair breaches before you can repair a system). Therefore, destroying a system and then nuking it with heavy lasers (killing the crew trying to repair it, and causing hull breaches) is still effective!  You become a lot better the more you play. Now, I win about 1/4 games on normal. In the beginning, I played about 30 times before winning a game.   Long story short – FTL is a work of art. It deserves a spot in the Louvre. It is an amazing rogue like game with some excellent programming. I haven’t found one bug, nor has the game ever crashed.  These programmers deserve an Nobel prize for this game. Well done.

And that's paramount. Even the best of us lose our faith sometimes. Faster Than Light is one of those games that comes out of nowhere and makes you a believer again. It is a testament to the brilliance of design over budget and as such is a shining beacon of this medium.  In Faster Than Light, the player takes on the role of a starship captain whose singular goal is to defend the Federation from a rebel threat. The concept is simple, you have to make it through seven grueling sectors to face the mammoth rebel flagship which will mercilessly put your nerves and skill to the test. It employs tough but fair school of design in which you will dearly pay for every single mistake you make, no matter how small. You may not even realize your mistake until it is too late.  You start with a barebones crew and equipment which you'll want to heavily upgrade by the time you reach the end. You'll achieve that by travelling through the galaxy, doing quests, fighting or aiding other ships or just buying whatever you can afford. This is a roguelike so every playthrough is completely different with randomized quests and loot drops. Sometimes you may feel slighted by the item drops or the difficult situations you find yourself in, but almost every piece of equipment is useful in some way and there's almost always a way out of a sticky situation. Being a roguelike also means that if you die, you have to start all over again. The sense of urgency is further heightened by the oncoming rebel fleet which won't allow you to roam the galaxy however you wish. Absolutely everything in Faster Than Light is subject to careful forethought and planning, otherwise you might just back yourself into a corner.  As the ship's captain, it is your duty to take care of absolutely everything that goes on your ship, the design is meticulously detailed. You have absolute control over a variety of systems including engines, shields, weapons, medbay, oxygen supply, helm, sensors, even doors. You also control every single crewmember. There are different races in the game and each specializes in a certain trait (except for humans). For example, Engis repair damaged systems faster, the Rock are immune to fire whereas the Mantis are great for ship intruders.  This all might sound overwhelming and there's actually a lot more various nuances to talk about here, but the tutorial is fantastic and you'll get the hang of the game quickly. This is a classic case of easy to learn, difficult to master.  The universe in Faster Than Light is pretty basic, it borrows liberally from various other sci-fi sources. Nevertheless, it is expertly put together. It is a very believable universe in which you'll learn about what's going on mostly through direct gameplay when interacting with other races and factions.  The Advanced Edition adds more content to the game most notably a new race with a new ship, fantastic new weapons and new upgrades such as mind control, cloning bay and hacking. The completely free expansion fleshes out the universe even further, but much more importantly it adds a myriad of new combinations of tactics that are at your disposal.  Faster Than Light is an exceptional work of game design. Its biggest accomplishment, which so few games manage to pull off, is that it draws you in, hooks you and never lets go. It is extremely addictive, even when you lose horribly and quit the game, all it takes is a few seconds and you're thinking about what you could've done differently and what tactics you will use next time you fire it up. And then you click play. Again.  10 OUT OF 10 (MASTERPIECE)","hours":138.4}

You are given a spaceship and a crew, and have to travel through space while staying alive, eventually reaching a final boss which must be destroyed using weapons and power-ups you obtain through your journey. In space you encounter random events such as enemy ships to fight, a stranded ship that will either reward you for your help or betray you and fight back, solar flares that will burn your ship down unless you extinguish the fires quickly, nebula storms that disable some of your ship's systems as well as your enemies' which makes battles more interesting, and stores where you can buy and sell equipment for currency called scrap, you get scrap from winning battles and finding it randomly. This game is unforgiving and punishment is heavy for mistakes you make. Remember to make good decisions because you will want every bit of advantage when fighting the boss.  Now as for combat, it has solid mechanical depth. If I had to describe it I'd say it's like a tactical rhythm based RTS. You need to time your attacks well for maximum damage efficiency, sounds easy until you realize you have to micromanage a dozen of things at once. There's a pause button which is VERY important and almost integral to combat, the main core steps to winning a battle usually are: -Pause. -Analyze the situation (intercept your enemy's attacks, see which systems need repairing, check your weapon cooldown timers.) -Issue crew and weapon orders. -Unpause. -Repeat.  What makes this game even more enjoyable is the soundtrack, it changes depending on your situation. It's usually calm electronic beeps while exploring and adds drums in battle which really gets you in the mood for fighting.  Well made and polished, one of the best indie games to ever be made. Hard to believe it was developed by 2 people (3 if you consider the music composer, Ben Prunty is amazing.)","hours":79.4}

Out run and out wit the Rebels in order to win. The game has you deciding whether or not to shoot at specific subsystems on the enemy ship, open an airlock to suffocate the invaders on your ship, or even sending one of your own crew to be a slave...  On a run by run basis the game can vary through its great use of procedural generation of the galaxy you have to run through. The choices you make on a second by second basis can either make or break a specific run. There are very few flaws I have found with the game, I think the one is that it is a cruel RNG god that you must play against. The RNG can totally bone you or make your run a perfect one, just depends on what mood it is in.  In conclusion, I believe this is one of the those games that everyone needs to play at some point during their lifetime. It in my mind is one of the parents of the indie revolution that started indies being popular. I give it a 5/5... rock solid gold it is.

It was a stealth ship - gifted by the Engi, a race of half organic half mechanical engineers who seeked to assist the Federation in any way they could. The Federation of course, were more than happy to accept the gift - In particular Tomas, JP and Shelton who were estatic at commandeering this state of the art technology. To aid them in the task, they hired an Engi, an act which they agreed would be fitting for it's first journey.  Off they went, with hope hanging on a basic cloak system, the glaive beam and a couple of lasers. It was tough going at first without a shield, but they managed to rescue a Mantis, save a Rockman and acquire a drone. With a growing crew and the debris of pirates and foolish aggressors in their wake, the ragtag bunch of aliens fled the ever advancing rebel fleet. At one point the rebel fleet and the stealth ship clashed - but Tomas held steady at the helm, trusting his new crew members to fend off the enemies who boarded the craft and fired incessantly upon the blue-black creature. At one point, the engine caught fire - and JP came running out, it was unfortunately too much for a human. The gruff Rockman took one look, went in, and came out unscathed.   It was a close one - they managed to escape and maintain some distance, but clearly things needed an improvement. And so in a timelapse-esque style, the ship grew in power and systems - upgraded engines, triple shields, terrifying drones and an energy sucking glaive beam that nearly bankrupted them all. But the stats of this weapon were too good to pass up, and Tomas the captain willingly threw in most of the ship's power to accomodate the beast.   A few scrapes and cloaking maneuvers by Shelton made complete mincemeat of anyone who dared challenge the stealth ship, and by now the Rockman had made a friend, who was more than willing to see the mission through. Elsewhere, a young mantis teenager eager to participate in war games hopped on from his homelands, making the group seven in total. Though they all spoke different languages, and had different ideals, none dared challenge the eternal darkness and death that came with space, and it was this silent wish to live that propeled them onwards, as an engine would propel a shuttle.   Of course, all journeys have to lead somewhere. For the lucky 7, it was time for the final battle. The rebel flagship closed in and Tomas maneuvered the craft with expert skill. Meanwhile, Shelton hammered at the enemy, drones fully engaged whilst the Rockmen focused their efforts on keeping the shields and cloak in orchestrated time. The Mantis ran around the cabins watching the carnage unfold - his time would come.  Yet the mistake soon presented itself - the glaive beam was a too slow and power hungry and a wayward shot took it out almost immediately, leaving the ship with pitiful lazers. A barrage of missiles punctured metal and ripped debris into space - and with it, a horrible whine and woosh as air vacated the mangled rooms. It was at this time that the enemy teleported in, and the Mantis sprung into action. He clawed and carved his way through flesh and bone. The rockmen ran from room to room, extinguishing fires. Too little too late. With alarms blaring, Tomas looked on in horror - the engines were down, the health station was completely engulfed in fire and worse of all, the oxygen system had failed. Leaving the controls of what was now a sitting duck, the frightened Engi and Tomas crouched over the oxygen system, desperately trying to revive the lungs of a cold beast.   Meanwhile, the Mantis was not having a easy time. Inexperienced and without help, a delicate dash ensued, as he dodged through vacuumed rooms and flaming debris. Dazed and terribly hurt, he headed to the engines. JP was nowhere to be seen - he was in fact also horribly injured, and lay in the sensor room, flames just feet away.  Shelton had in this time also suffered terribly - first fire, then half his health to suffocation - he left the Rockmen to deal with the flames and crawled back to his controls, and it was then he realised that in all the frantic action, and with the ship 2 bars to oblivion, his prized drones were still up and running! The words hull critical flashed over and over through his screen, but he took several deep breaths.. and waited.   The enemy ship turned to face them, it's weapons drawn, ready to seal the fate of it's prey. Shelton paused. There. The drones took the shield down for a split second and Shelton fired.  A single desperate lazer shot made itself across the minute gap, past the regenerating shield. It tore into the hull and hit the engine with a horrifying explosion. In space, no one can hear you scream, and no one heard the explosions either. The crew watched as the flagship ripped itself apart. They were alive. Barely, but still alive.  And that is the story of my 7 man crew. Tomas and buddies/10. Highly recommended.","hours":53.9}

No turning back, everyone knows what must be done. Take down that Flagship at any cost.  Spirits are low on the ship, as our weapons are really underwhelming. Just a burst laser, a better burst laser and a rocket launcher that was on the ship since... nobody knows when. The speedy detour we took around the Flagship's path to the base yeilded nothing useful but the last pieces of scrap which we put into our cloning bay, as we had nothing else to spend it on.  Here it comes, with it's four giant guns pointed at us, it's powerful shields up, it's huge crew taking positions, the boarding party already teleporting, their cloak at the ready and their hacking drone already latched onto our sensors system. I fire off the mind control and all hell breaks loose. Volleys of every kind of projectile you can imagine fly towards us constantly, barrage after barrage. Soldiers pop up everywhere, blasting our reinforced doors and sabotaging our systems. I have full faith in my pilot, and he has full faith in the engine crew. I ask for an estimate dodge chance. 55%, he says, with a fearless look that gave me the courage to go on under all this crushing pressure.  Volley after volley, good ol' Kestrel did maneuvers I thought were impossible, dodging most of the missiles, lasers, beams and ion blasts as our weak weapons barely got through their shields. Every volley was a heart attack. Especially that missile launcher. The missiles that hit punched holes in our hull, draining it of oxygen, set the rooms ablaze and made the whole structure seem like it would collapse and shatter into hundreds of pieces at any second.  My crew valiantly fought all the fires and fixed every piece of electronics, as best as they could. My mind control caused chaos on the Flagship, and I could see it through the sensors when the hacking drone had to cool down, but even then, that ship was terrifyingly powerful. It was really disheartening to see the damage repaired while the hacking drone made mind control impossible as designating targets was not possible without our sensors, and the enemy ship cloaked. Yet we kept fighting. Bit by bit, we tore piece by piece off of it. Punched every little hole, one by one. Every last enemy soldier boarding our ship was suffocated mercilessly, and survivors that came crawling in were kicked while they were down. A final missile dislodged a huge chunk of it, and it looked like it was done.  We could not be more wrong.  The ship was just damaged, and it managed to emergency FTL jump away. I cursed everything. I had serious thoughts of jumping out of the airlock to end all this unbearable suffering. But then my pilot called me up on the comms.  \"So, let's finish this, eh? That hunk'o'junk hasn't seen all we got to offer yet!\"  Fifty five percent dodge chance. Five lasers and a missile. Fifty five percent. We can do this. I hope.  We quickly pulled back to patch up the few holes we had left and to let the oxygen generator refill our ship, almost starved from the vital gas by all the breaches, and got ready for round two. The first round was just the tip of the iceberg, and true hell had only begun.  Even with a huge chunk missing, and with it one of it's signature cannons, it was not any weaker. In fact, it only became tougher after reinforcements beamed into it and it deployed it's drone system. Drones swarmed us, shooting up the shields, breaching our hull and running around destroying everything. These drones were tough. They would literally punch a hole in one of our outer walls, enter a room and begin trashing it. No oxygen. Even our toughest crewmembers needed to team up on one to stand the slighest chance of taking them down. It would be all quickly over if not for the cloning bay. But what truly amazed me, was their resolve. These were people that died up to a dozen times within just a few minutes. They would throw themselves at the terrifying robots, just holding their breath, and take them down with their own corpses if necessary. I could not have asked for a more valiant crew, nor I deserved to.  But as the bloody territory war was fought inside our ship, a war of attrition with no clear winner was happening on the outside. Their defense drones would render our lowly missile launcher useless, and our lasers needed a perfect volley to simply scratch their hull. Meanwhile, the barrages went on. Fifty five percent dodge. My pilot is doing his job. Maybe he's scared. I'm sure we all are. But he doesn't show it. Oftentimes I feel he is holding the ship and all us together, preventing us from snapping and giving up. But there is no time to delve into these things when the mind control is recharged and awaits it's target.  We keep on going, our ship, good ol' Kestrel, starting to give in to all the stray shots and holes the breaching drones are making. My screen light up with warnings. It is hard to breathe, really hard. We can barely keep ourselves supplied. The Flagship is not giving in. All we've done is superficial damage.  An explosion and a warning brings grim news. Our oxygen generator room is breached, and the drone is already breaking down the door to the backup battery. Two good men, or, rather, a man and a woman's sacrifice drops the scary robot. Close to passing out from the lack of oxygen, I give order to repair the generator. \"Just hold your breath... alright?\" The ship is in utter chaos. Everyone is leaving their pot and doing side jobs and emergency maintenance more than their real jobs. After the two newly-appointed engineers collapse on the floor, the oxygen is fixed, and we can all breathe again... sort of. Though there are more breaches to fix, and more drones coming in.  I start having my doubts, and angrily fire our surplus missiles at their defense drone fruitlessly, just out of rage. But then it happens.  A lucky laser hit a sensitive control board. Or a munitions box. Or... who cares. Their engine room was set ablaze, and I seized the chance to mind control the operator. With the improved abilities the mind control gave them, they fended off their allies until the fire was so big it was out of control. Their engines were down. They could not dodge. This was the miracle we needed. All of our lasers focused their shields system. Four shield layers, five shots. It was easy with a stationary target. After a few volleys their shield went down. With a nice fire to go with it. A final mind control took the lives of every last operator in the ship, besides the weapons specialists in their sealed main cannon chambers. The Flagship was ablaze, and their drone control system soon went down. With no defense drones or engines, even our humble weapons made quick work of it.  But it had one last trick up it's sleeve. A last bail-out FTL jump. We healed the heavily wounded and took positions. We are ready. It comes back. It looks... not very threatening. It's main cannons motly disabled, no crew to repair the damages... The fire was put out, but... my mind control didn't go through. Something was up with their shields. Even our missiles collided with them. I give the order and our weapons keep firing at them. And then it happens. A power surge warning. A power surge? But, their drone system is destroyed beyond repair, and their main cannons are barely functional, what could it be, I asked myself. As if answering my question, the biggest laser volley I've ever seen lit up the emptiness of space. I could not even count how many there were. Too many. But, somehow, our pilot dodges most of them. Leaving the shields to do their jobs. After it's shields went down, the Flagship's fate was sealed.  We all cheered, victorious. I will always admire you, Will.  55% dodge/10","hours":50.7}

And you want to know something about my trip? I loved every second of it.  FTL is a sci-fi lover's (like myself) dream. Filled with references here and homages there, it never slows down, the action is always frantic yet methodical, and it's an absolute delight.  FTL is a Real-Time Strategy game (with a turn-based element). You control a ship and its crew from an over-head, side on perspective. There is no movement of ship to control beyond jumping from beacon to beacon.  When it comes time to fight your first ship (probably in the tutorial, seriously, do the tutorial), you can pause time by pressing the space-bar, to assess your options and your tactics, in a similar way to that of games like Dragon Age: Origins or The Bureau: XCOM Declassified. You must make sure at all times that your crew are alive and your hull (your health meter) isn't about to reach zero, or it's game-over. This is easier said than done, because the amount of micro-management is ENDLESS, to the point where it is all micro-management and there isn't any priority management, per say. You need to make sure you have enough power to all systems, no intruders are going to come on board, that you are doing damage to their ship, and if not, charging your FTL jump (your \"I NEED TO GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!\" button), among countless other things.   This game is BRUTAL. There are 3 difficulties (if you use the Advanced Edition, a major free DLC added to the game in 2014, you can still use the Vanilla version that was the original release): Easy, Normal, and Hard. The only real difference between them is how long you can hold out before being smashed. You need to get through 8 sectors and 1 final boss to complete a run (and subsequently, the game). The final boss is so hard, that even nearly 70 hours into the game (at the time of this review), I STILL haven't beaten it... even on easy.  And yet, despite this massive, massively overwhelming difficulty, I wouldn't have this game any other way. Because without it, this game would have FAR less replay ability. But with it, each new run feels completely different. New tactics you might need to try, new ship purchases in hope of finding that Magnum Opus that is your favourite weapon, new dialogues, everything. Without this difficulty, all that wouldn't matter, because after beating it, you would feel less compelled to try differently, and get bored a lot quicker, something I am only realizing after so many hours.   Everything this game does should be a set example for games in future years. It gets everything right, the customization, the balance of every factor, excitement. Even it's techno music (I just hurt the souls of many electronic music fans), something I don't particularly enjoy, is absolutely fantastic in this game. To put all this into perspective, I got my Dad to play this game, and even he has since clocked 30+ hours of his own time in the game.  So with my melted face from my time in the Somalian weather, I must insist everyone who considers themselves an open (to all games) gamer, to play this game. It helps new players find their feet, then punches them down when they have the hang of it. It screams in the face of master strategists and sends them cowering. It is one of the most soul-destroying, exciting, charming, addictive, challenging, fun games out there.   It's the best Strategy game I have ever played.  PROS:  +Good tutorial +Fun, Challenging +Good Interface, Music. +TONS of replay ability  CONS: -Your face may melt off  I'm giving FTL: Faster Than Light 9 out of 10.","hours":74.4}

{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.7005312408181096,"review":"FTL is a unique rogue-like title: It features all the common elements of the genre such as randomly-generated events that may help or harm you, permadeath and high difficulty. What makes this one special though, is that instead of controlling a single character, you control the crew of your ship.  This game puts you in control of almost everything: You order your crew to specific rooms, be it to provide your ship with a bonus, repair a broken system, patch a hull breach, fight enemy boarders or put out fires.  Meanwhile you as the player has to make smart decisions which involves opening or closing airlocks to \"kill\" fires or suffocate enemy invaders, managing your reactor's power to decide what do you want operating at full, partial or no capacity at this particular moment, and figuring out which enemy system you want to try and take out with your ship's weapons.  Almost everything in this game is randomly generated with very few exceptions such as your ship's starting equipment.  This game also features achievements (general and ship-specific) and unlockable ships: You can have 9 different ships, each with 2 different layouts for a total of 18. They are really different in playstyle and can make your game way easier or way harder depending on your choices. This can provide you with some replayability, if you are into \"collecting\". Some ships can be really hard to find, however.  The difficulty may discourage some people from playing it, but that's a fact with nearly every rogue-like. The way I see it, this is how it goes: When you start a run, there's a chance you will fail and that chance will never go away. What you can do about is use what you can find and devise good strategies to make that chance of failure as minimal as possible.   The graphics and soundtrack are not \"high-tech\" but are very artistic instead. If you are a fan of pixel art and chiptune music (which you can also buy as DLC). This game delivers an incredible experience in that aspect. Not everyone likes those though, so I recommend you watch the teaser to get a feel of it if you haven't already.  Finally, if there's anything bad I can say about this game is that the random encounters/events are kinda limited and you'll soon figure out the best course of action for most of them. They could use slightly more variety. A very minor complaint, in my opinion.  So, if you are after a game that will provide you with a unique \"star-trek-ish\" crew/ship managing experience based on randomly generated elements, then FTL is well-worth the price for you!","hours":284.9}

Never fear: instead of sending your soldiers in to put the fire out, simply open the doors to space and let the vacuum do it for you.  Piratical praying mantises have just teleported into your cockpit, and if you'd upgraded your doors, they wouldn't be tearing through the ship, and your soldiers, like a hot knife through butter. But you didn't, because you wanted a bigger gun. So now you're all dead.  A massive laser has cut a hole in your engine room, and you've sent half your crew to patch it up. Hope you remembered to open the ship's interior doors to balance out the atmosphere, so they don't suffocate in the process.  Two of your crew have teleported to the enemy ship and are sabotaging its cloaking generator. To keep the enemy out, you've hacked the cloaking device--including its doors. Now, their heavily-upgraded door system is keeping them out, not you.  You've got two crew left, and one of them just got mind-controlled by your alien foe. The engine room is his domain, now--but your last crew member is safe in the pilot's seat, behind a thick, thick door.  ---  Almost every game has doors in it, but few of them do much with them.

{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.827831669502151,"review":"TL;DR? See Conclusion  INTRODUCTION: Faster than Light is a 'Space Rogue-Like' game that came into being by virtue of a Kickstarter project by Indie Developer Subset Games. It promises a starship captain experience where the player can manage both crew and ship in relative detail.  PLOT (No Spoilers): The player takes the role of a Starship Captain with vital information that will help turn the tide of war in the on going conflict between the Rebels and the Federation. The player is allowed to select and manage a variety of ships, each having their own set of crew and abilities which can expand as you progress. Once again, upgrade your ship, expand your crew and try to stay alive till the very end.  PROS: + Gameplay over Graphics: - The game sports simple pixel art graphics that invokes a retro feel, and, in my opinion, suits it very well. The gameplay is what makes this game shine however and as stated in the INTRODUCTION, this game attempts to simulate a Starship captain by letting the player assign crew to man the ships internal systems, order power to be diverted to different parts of the ship, focus fire on an enemy ship's weapon systems and many many more.  + Stratigically Brutal: - Easy, Normal or Hard, all extremley unforgiving. This is a game where you need to bite down hard and take the consequences of your actions and choices like an adult, much like all 'Rogue-Like' games. You die, then you start all-over again. Learning from your mistake is part of the game's charm.  + Wide Variety of Stuff: - Good varriety of ships, weapons, and crew all of which unlocks as you progress. The unlocking system was set up to ensure that every new game will be different and provide unique experiences.  + Soundtrack: - Great soundtrack from a small indie game. Bigger game developers should learn that not every game needs orchestral pieces to make a game's music pleasing.  CONS: - No ship customization: - Aside from purchasing weapon system and ship components, you won't be able to customize the ship's looks or the layout since said layout is on a preset. I would have liked to construct my own ship.   - One Game Mode: - The only available game mode is the default escape scenario. It would be nice if they would add new campaigns or scenarios like, escort mission, defense campaign etc. It would definitely spice things up. A much more expansive map would also be welcome.  - Crew Interaction: - Being able to talk and may be train your crew outside combat (specially if you find an empty system) would be a welcome addition. More interaction is needed like basic dialogues between the people on your ship to give it more life. It would be a statisfying feeling if you have resolved a conflict between two crew members.  CONCLUSION: GREAT GAME for a great price. It's definitely not for everyone, specially people who has no patience for Rogue-Like games.   This games requires 25% skill, 25% planning and 50% luck. Everytime you start a new campaign it would be a different experience from the last. The game allows most sci-fi fans to totally immerse themselves in the shoes of a Starship captain much like the heroes from the great Space Travel franchises such as Star Trek, Firefly, Babylon 5 & Battlestar Galactica.  ---------------------------------------------------------  Like my Reviews?

But since you asked, I'll say why:  The gameplay is great. You really want to start on Easy, and use the pause button very frequently. It's really a turn based game don't try to play it in real time. Then just try stuff, explore solar systems, and have a great time. Normal mode is hard enough that lots of people never beat it, and then they added a hard more that really is tough.  The graphics are very simple but also very clean and clear. There is a lot more variation visually than you might think, but you will always know exactly what is happening at a glance. The music is really, really great. You don't need to be a fan of any specific type of music to appreciate how well the tone is constantly transmitted to you. Personally I wind up turning the music off in any game I play after a while, because you have heard it sooo many times, but with FTL I turn it back on, sometimes.  There is lots of content to see. The different types of ships can change the tactical combat hugely, all kinds of things will have effects on the interactions you will have. Some people get frustrated because they have a hard time beating the final boss of the game, but the truth is that exploring the galaxy in various ways and encountering various things, the basic gameplay itself, is the point. The first time I got to the boss it was an accident and I was disappointed because I didn't get to finish the delivery quest I was working on.  I have over 100 hours logged into Steam, and this game has gotten me through at least one long internet-free vacation on top of that. Most of that was before they added a huge, free expansion pack, too. If tactical turn based rougue like lite whatever space exploration sounds fun to you, at all, you will get some time out of this.  The cherry on top of the FTL sundae is the price, it's been in a few bundles and goes 70-85% off pretty frequently. It's worth it at any price, really.","hours":107.6}
