{"funny_percent":0.05,"helpful_percent":0.7097543062245341,"review":"Overall, one of the best games i have ever played. When i played back in 2010-2011, i didnt realize how good it actually was. And im talking about both experiences: singleplayer and multiplayer. Now, 2016, i bought this game on the steam winter sale. And god, what a good choice this was. About the multiplayer: its the strong point of MW2. The community may be smaller now, since there have been so many new CoD games, but there are still people playing. You can find a party even 4 am on a wednesday. The multiplayer quality is fantastic. The amount of content keeps you coming back for more. A lot of customization options, which includes call signs, emblens, perks, attachments... Killstreaks are a good reward for the players skills. I personally like the matchmaking system instead of dedicated servers, becouse it keeps the game alive, becouse everyone can become a host, we all know there are a lot of limitations to host a dedicated server.  There is also a mode that can be played both singleplayer and multiplayer, called Special Ops. Here you do some very cool missions, usually not very long. They use some locations from the campaing. But its very good becouse its VERY challenging. Its very skill based, and it will take you some time and patience to do all Spec Ops missions. Its much more fun to do with a friend rather than doing alone. Spec Ops gives MW2 a very unique perspective over the other CoD games, becouse in my opinion its a better mode than Survival and Zombies. And theres the singleplayer campaing, which continues the story from MW in a very good way. The story is short, you can probably beat in in 5-6 hours in the regular difficulty, but its a very entertaing story about war. Although you probably wont spend a lot of time in this mode, you will enjoy the cinematics and the whole story a lot. Is MW2 the best CoD game so far? Yes. Best FPS game so far? No, but one of the bests. But wait, isnt the game too old? Yes and no. \"Yes\" becouse it was launched 7 years ago, but \"no\" becouse the game aged really well in all aspects. Im talking mostly about graphics and gameplay. ","hours":805.2}

In the 4th Level, \"No Russian\", the player has the option to shoot innocent bystanders with no in-game penalty. Understandably, this created a huge protest among the police and the general public. But I feel that because of this controversial level, the developers were able to rise into instant fame and the game broke a couple of sales record back in 2009.  Setting this aside, this has to be one of the best Call of Duty games ever created by the developers. The graphics looks great even in 2017 and the gameplay is superb.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 manages to build upon its predecessor Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and create what every Call of Duty game should aim to be. This means fast-paced combat with balanced weapons alongside decent graphics that represent the optimum power of technology the year it was created. This is exactly what Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has done and why it stands out to me as the best Call of Duty game to this date.","hours":3.8}
{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.8476542639964488,"review":"Whether you prefer Single Player, CO-OP or Multiplayer, this game has all three of them. I have reviewed all three parts of the game if you are considering buying this.   CAMPAIGN REVIEW (Single Player):  The campaign is about 6 hours long roughly. It can be shorter or longer depending on your selected difficulty. The story itself is very good and is set 5 years on from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. It is not a Hollywood Blockbuster but at the same time it is not some random quickly written story that was put together in a few hours. Every mission has different objectives and you can feel the climax building up to the finale of the game. Every level is action filled and there is never a dull moment in the campaign. As you progress you will play in different locations in the world such as: Afghanistan, Brazil, Russia, the Atlantic Ocean and the United States. Even after completing the story there are Intel collectables to find and of course Steam achievements. There are also quite a few Easter Eggs in the campaign levels. The story for this then continues on into Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3  SPEC OPS REVIEW (Single Player / CO-OP):  The Special Op missions are mostly the campaign levels but switched the other way round and with different objectives in the level. There are a total of 23 spec ops missions in MW2. 21/23 of these can be done on your own or with a friend. There are 2 Spec Ops missions that can only be done with a 2nd player. The missions get harder and harder as they go on. Some of the levels in this have been re-used from COD4. There is no matchmaking for the Spec Ops so the only way to find another player is to invite / join a friend and begin playing. There are also quite a few Steam achivements for this like with the Campaign.  MULTIPLAYER REVIEW (Multiplayer):  The Multiplayer is what is considered the strongest part of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Unlike COD4 this time the game uses Steam Cloud, so your rank will all be stored online and will sync every time you close MW2. The highest level you can reach is level 70 with the addition of 10 prestige levels. When you reach Rank 4 you will have the ability to create your own classes where you can choose your main weapon, secondary weapon, perks and equipment. You can also stick attachments to pretty much all of your weapons on here. You can also unlock weapon camos for your main firearms, which some look very cool when placed on. You have the ability to join friends in a session and vice versa (provided there is space) and host your own private matches for this.    Conclusion: I highly recommend buying this game if you are reading this out of personal interest or if the game has gone up for sale. I recommend playing the Campaign before going to Multiplayer to get a feel of the game, but it is of course entirely your decision.  Things to be aware of -   There is no direct controller support for this game.   If you are considering the DLCs, it should be noted that there are less players than that of 2009 - 2010, so the only two main playlists are the base game and those who own both of the DLCs. If you only buy 1 DLC, you will find literally 0 games on there.  MW2 Multiplayer has no dedicated servers. It uses a matchmaking system that will pair you up with other players in the same playlist and game mode as you.  This game uses VAC. So if you are banned for cheating / modding the game, your ban will be permanent. There is no way to lift a ban. You have been warned.  At the time of posting the Multiplayer peak for this is around 10,000 players which is more than enough to find a game and play. Campaign / Spec Ops population doesn't go above 5,000.  If you have any questions or concerns with the game feel free to leave a comment.

I am not a big fan of the latest games from this franchise, but back at the day - I was having a blast playing this game. And guess what? It still rocks.   SP campaign is a high-octane rollercoaster ride and it still feels like you are a starring role in some Hollywood action blockbuster movie. Full of special effects, slow-mo scenes, vehicle driving, and stealth missions and of course tons and tons of great shooting - the gameplay delivers that well known COD look, feel and play. It can be overwhelming at times, but that is what you can expect from these games.  Spec Ops are a welcomed addition to the game, as the challenges will be taken a step further. They are designed in that way, that you will always crave for more of them, and kept pushing yourself to be a bit more precise, faster and smarter.  MP is the foundation of this game, as it is polished to the max, but still stripped from those things that ruined many (but not all) of the COD titles that followed this one. And the best part - people are still actively playing it!   All in all - this package is one of the finest packages that you can find if you are an FPS player.

Well it is a simple First Person Shooter game with easy and simple mechanics (like almost every FPS game). I found the Single Player storyline interesting and awesome (great fights, and great scenes in general) and I have to admit that I wanted MORE of it when I finally finished it. Although there were many negative reviews and comments about it, and to be more specific, about the mission \"No Russian\" in which you are asked if you really want to play it or skip it, I think that Modern Warfare 2 is a worty replacer of its predecessor Modern Warfare, which was a huge success for Infinity Ward.
