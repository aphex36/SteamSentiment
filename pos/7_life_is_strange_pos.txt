{"review":"I love this game. It's different, rich in story, and will make even the coldest of hearts feel emotional. First time finishing the game (before I got it on Steam) I was up at 3 in the morning bubbling like a baby when I finished  This game, although it has it's flaws, is a masterpiece. DontNod made a wonderful game and has proven that their small team can make an amazing, beautiful, heartfelt game. I paid for the 1st episode before it was released on Steam for free, but even spending a few extra dollars was worth it, as this game has taken me through the incredible and emotional journey of Max Caulfield and Chloe Price.  Pros: Beautiful indie sountrack Fun use of timetraveling powers Different (and stunning) graphics Relatable characters/situations Not afraid to talk about uncomfortable topics (assault, deaths of loved ones, suicide, ect) Most small choices still have a meaningful impact Strong replay value Many subtle refrences to shows/movies/memes  Likable characters Very atmospheric, it feels like a real town Has an unusual but nice mechanism where you can take a \"Moment of Calm\" and sit down on a bed/swing/bench, and just look at the world around you while calming music plays Beautiful locations and scenery  Cons: Voice acting/script can be cringy at times  Is short (but as stated before is replayable) Can be cliche at times  Overall this game is not one to miss. Even with it's flaws, Life is Strange is one game you shouldn't miss.","hours":19.3,"funny_percent":0.011458333333333333,"helpful_percent":0.9708333333333333}

{"review":"It's strange how this will be the first review I ever write for a game. I always thought it would be written for a game like Fallout, Elderscrolls or some huge open world survival horror. And yet it's this little piece of art that has me aching to write something, if only for a minute. When I had finished this, a few minutes ago, I couldn't believe that they only charge a pittence for it. I thought to myself that if people can charge you 70 euro for games that are poorly executed and badly made from start to finish, then this game should have a much higher pricetag. It wasn't before looking up and seeing that I just finished the first episode in a mere three hours that I understood their reasoning. I feel, however, obliged to tell you all that the three hours spent in this game were worth more to me than the hundreads of hours I've spent in most other games combined. Not because the story was awsome, or the graphics made me gape in awe, but rather that every single aspect of the game in combination managed to grip me and pull me in so that time became temporarily meaningless. Imagine if games held this standard. Imagine if your favorite action, your favorite adventure game or even your favorite driver had this kind of execution.  You can tell a good story in a bad way, and you can tell a bad story in a good way. The story in this game might not be the most interesting story you've ever heard, but it's good, and in the execution of it you are drawn in, captured by it, moved by it.  Most adventure games will entertain, they'll give you some ups and downs along the way, but ultimately they will feel like games. I've never felt so fulfilled after \"playing a game\" as I did today. Original, beautiful and masterfully executed. I can't wait for the next episode.","hours":27.1,"funny_percent":0.03117692907248636,"helpful_percent":0.9545336451026241}

{"review":"I bought this game for £5. I now realise it is worth so much more; how I missed this game for two years I don't know, I'm glad I finally got around to playing it; I haven't felt like this in a long time after playing a game, a completely lifechanging experience.   Life is Strange is slightly similar to games of the Telltale series, your choices affect the outcome of the game and make subtle and huge changes throughout. You feel empathy for the characters in the world, and whilst handling mature themes such as depression, the game grips you to your seat. It is amazing! A masterpiece. The writers are on par with some of the best TV shows and films out there, it makes you question every choice you make, your own reality. As a player you actually feel like you affect the relationships between the characters.  The music and art design are unique and aesthetically pleasing, which is a nice change from the usual games I play. The voice acting's brilliant, the lip synchronization is not so much, but it is not awful.  Without spoiling anything, the twists in this game, WOW. I can see why this game has critical acclaim.  Finally I must end saying how much I recommend this game. I've experienced nothing like it before, if you read this. Please try this game. You won't regret it.","hours":12.7,"funny_percent":0.004415011037527594,"helpful_percent":0.9459161147902869}
{"review":"This is probably the realest review for a game I will ever do... Coming from a guy who never shows emotions, has been gaming for a good 12 years and has mainly been playing horror, FPS, and MMOs those twelve years...  I both see and feel why this game has a warning about support groups for real life... This game guilt-trips you so hard and then kicks your emotions around like it's a soccer ball...  I haven't had this much of an emotional roller coaster in, well... ever. I've never had a video game make me tear up before... Life Is Strange changed that.  Easily my \"Game Of The Year\". I know a lot of triple-a titles came out this year, and I know Life Is Strange doesn't get as much attention as other game... but holy hell you guys. I've never played a game with such an in-depth story as I have with Life Is Strange... Hell, I've NEVER even played a game that kept me up all night, wondering about what the next episode will be, or how my actions in the last episode might impact me...  This is a game that I will never forget, and it is most likely a game that I will always come back to.    Now, for those of you that are thinking \"ah, ♥♥♥♥ this game. It's a story-based game, it's practically a virtual novel! Who cares!\"... Take this from someone who was \"that guy\", and said almost exactly that before trying this game...

{"review":"Life is Strange isn't hard, yet it hits you hard. Life is Strange isn't challenging, yet it shows daily challenges. Life is Strange isn't long, yet its impact lasts long. Life is Strange isn't a puzzle, yet it leaves you puzzled. Life is Strange isn't giving questions, yet it offers answers. Life is Strange isn't replayable, yet finds in the replay its core. Life is Strange isn't real, yet it feels so. Life is Strange isn't about relationship, friensdhip, love, hate, light or darkness. It's about the most underestimated gift: life.  I am unable to call it \"game\" as it would lose all the artistic veil surrounding Arcadia Bay. Art is something you perceive, it is something that comes out of the blue without a reason or a purpose. Art is something you can perceive in every step Max takes, and this is how I would label Life is Strange: art. Dontnod has made a terrific job and gives us lessons that we can easily detatch from this title and apply it in our everyday life. All the serious themes covered in such a little time amount made me understand the reason why the developers have opened a support group for those who felt really affected by some of them.  And perhaps the core of this experience is simple and complicated at the same time: Life is hard, life is challenging, life is short, life is puzzling, life is uncertain, life is one only, life is strange.

{"review":"This game deserves a love letter, not a review. So here it goes..  Dear Lis,  Ever since you showed up, you’ve caught everyone’s attention. Although not mine, at least not until I kept hearing your name and seeing your pictures everywhere. Everyone talking about your beauty, perfection, mystery and how interesting you were. Boys and girls, all were in love with Lis. Which made me very intrigued. So I watched you closely but I kept a distance, because you were not even my type. I can’t deny it, sometimes I was attracted to you and wanted to approach you. But sadly I didn’t have money on me, so I couldn’t. So I accepted fate, and kept my distance.  Until one day, I had enough money. But I wasn’t sure anymore if I wanted you or not. I wasn’t sure if you would even notice me among all these 75 million users. I was just a nobody. I thought of other options, but for some reason, my heart preferred you. I don’t know why or what it was. But I knew you were the one. Among thousands of other choices, I chose you Lis... I think it was destiny. Do you believe in destiny Lis?  I still remember our first date. I waited for you for so long. Was a bad internet day. Then you finally came. I‘ve never been so excited to see someone this much before. And for some reason, something about you moved me. I felt this incredible strong connection between us. I felt ridiculously relaxed, comfortable, confident and very interested in you. We started getting to know each other, and you kept me even more and more interested in you. The date ended fast, even though it wasn’t really. It’s just that you made time travel faster than light. I hated it when you had to go. You promised me of another date, and that’s what kept me going.  The date was there, you looked even more beautiful than ever. Was another perfect day we had together. Until you touched me in a way, I couldn’t understand or know what to feel or think. Caught me off guard, surprised me. It was.. so good! Too good! But sadly you had to go. You left and left me with this fire burning inside me. So many questions, mixed emotions.. I didn’t know what was happening to me! So many questions going through my head. I wanted answers but I had to wait for the next time I see you. I was quiet the whole time, listening to you, melting with you, flying with you. You even brought tears into my eyes. It was a flawless experience. All my worries faded away and I was happy again. Then it was your time to leave, again.. but before you did, you rocked my world!! You left me again with all these emotions and questions. What were you doing to me Lis!!? These feelings, never felt anything like them before, ever! What happened on our last meeting has been on my mind since you left. You were all I could think of. Waiting for our next meeting was the most intense feeling and important thing in my life at that point. But you were late Lis.. again.. I was scared, afraid that you changed your mind about me. That, you didn’t want me anymore. Until one day you said, October 20th you’ll be there. I smiled so wide until you said it was going to be our last time. It crushed me. Flipped my whole world upside down. I didn’t feel like doing anything anymore. You kept me up everynight. I’d roll over again and again. Hearing your name and seeing your pictures in my head. Remembering the things you made me feel. I had hopes that I might be able to change your mind and make you stay.   October 20th came. I was both excited and scared. I couldn’t see you. I’m so sorry Lis, I avoided you, stayed away from the feed. It hurt but I had to. Everyone was still talking about you, but it was only making me more furious.. But I knew I couldn’t hide from you forever, besides you were leaving me for good. So I needed to at least say goodbye.  October 21st. Which is today.. I waited for you. Again was another bad internet day. Then you showed up. My heart was beating so fast I almost fainted. I was so happy to see you again after so long, but at the same time, all those questions and emotions came back all at once. I wasn’t ready for it. It kept messing with my head the whole time. Taking me on this roller coaster of heightened emotions. Unanswered questions. You were vague yourself. You drove me crazy Lis. I had no clue what was happening. I was losing my mind and pulling my hair out. I was both scared and sad and happy and all at once. You’re doing it to me again Lis. Then when it was time for you to go, you just.. made me make the hardest decision of my life. I literally froze for 10 minutes. I didn’t know what to choose. I cared so much, it was so hard for me choose. But it didn’t matter after all, because whatever decision I was going to make, it wasn’t going to make you stay. So I chose. Tears started falling down one by one at the last sight of your beauty. The last time I hear your heavenly voice. The last time we laugh together, explore together, get mad together, get scared together, see the world together, and be happy… together…  Why Lis! How could you do this! I thought you were the one. I opened myself to you. We been through so much together! We changed past, present and future together! We created wonders! Put smiles on people’s faces! We made magic. It was all perfect. Then you just left me alone, sobbing, crying, screaming and bleeding love for you.  What I’m trying to say is that, I’m sitting here right now, writing this letter for you in my Asylum cell where I’m getting treated from the mind ♥♥♥♥s and emotions you put me through, that all the choices we made, all the memes we made, all the ships we fought for, all the music we heard, secrets we discovered, emotions we felt, tears we shed... will all remain. They will always stay dear in my heart and I will always love you...  Yours truly. Venus","hours":25.6,"funny_percent":0.43288434742220155,"helpful_percent":0.8880631676730144}

{"review":"My game of the year for 2015  Pros:  + Stunning story + Lovely graphics + Lovable characters + Great for screenshots + Choices are effective and testing + Great soundtrack, and very fitting + Has achievements and trading cards + Good implementation of choices matter + 5 episodes, all of which are gripping and lengthy  + They added developers commentary for free (it's dlc on the store page, just scroll back up) + Emotional, immersive and at some points heartbreaking, especially surrounding the choices with Kate and the final choice of the series.  Neutral Points:  > Has been some bugs in rare occassions but easily overlooked due to being such a great game  Cons:  - It ends - Max's clothing, I prefer her in Amber's clothes - Some choices don't have a big enough of an impact in the game - It can be argued that no choices mattered in the end, not going to spoil anything though  Download Size: 11542mb Trading cards: 6 in the set Achievement Difficulty: Easy to 100% Hours to 100%: 15-20  Rating: 10/10 Recommendation: A must buy!  My Opinion:  Despite the final choices and how it ends I am very content with the game as a whole and the build up, as well as the final outcome. It is a rollercoaster ride of emotions, hard choices and relatable characters. For me personally I got to re live a better school experience as a younger me while having time changing super powers. This is by far my favorite and best game choice of 2015, it was worth every penny and will always be a game etched into my memory.

{"review":"To not give this game a review would simply be an injustice, considering how deeply this game affected me and how genuinely thought-provoking it was.   I've played many episodic games but I don't think I can say there was one that made me pause the game several times, process what just happened, and then come back to it after a few hours. To say this game's perfect would be a lie, it's got faults like any other game, but where its strengths lie are in its ability to create a universe the player is incredibly invested in. I could rattle on and on like my usual Steam reviews but for this game only, and to avoid spoiling the story in any way, I've decided just to make a simple pros and cons list.  PROS - $20 price for the season pass - Performance was good and there was very few bugs for me - I really dug the unique art style (simple yet visually appealing) - The UI is intuitive and very simple - A solid story from start to finish (there might've been a few plot holes but I didn't notice any really) - Likeable female protagonist and a well-written relationship between her and the deuteragonist - Amazing atmosphere - Great voice talent (I think a few voices didn't feel \"right\" but everyone else was golden) - The song selection was fitting and appropriate - Different endings which were logical and nicely executed, to me, for a story that involves time travel (one ending could've been longer though and I suspect many fans might've preferred something less predictable) - Real choices that matter early on - The rewind mechanic wasn't gimmicky for the most part and I rather enjoyed all of the puzzles - The player doesn't take a backseat to the action like a lot of story games I felt (you feel like you're playing a game) - A lot of extra content in the episodes (various diary entires, optional photos to take, SMS messages, etc.) - Explores a number of controversial issues and/or themes (that few games touch on) with tact  CONS - The pacing could've been slightly better in episodes 3 and 4 - Past choices don't matter as much in episodes 4 and 5 (I won't describe anything more to avoid spoiling the story) - Some characters are more or less stereotypes but each player will feel differently about this - The rare corny/cheesy phrase that would stick out (I can't think of an example right now)  I was initially going to include another con but yesterday's update addressed what was the biggest issue for many: the at-times horrible lip-syncing that barely matched the characters' words in the first 3 episodes. I'm glad to say that this has been addressed and I have to give the devs kudos for that. Now fans and newcomers alike will be able to enjoy this game even more.   This game will obviously not be for everyone but I do think it appeals to a lot of people (as seen by the Steam user reviews). It's quite simply a high school drama with a bit of mystery and the supernatural thrown in. If you had thought it was some feministic sort of game like I had initially - I urge you to give this game another look. I have tried to be as honest as I can about a game which I have thoroughly enjoyed and I hope this review has helped you, the reader, in some way. For $20 I highly recommend grabbing Life Is Strange and if you don't happen to enjoy it in the first hour or so: refund it. I don't think you will though :) It honestly deserves a 8.5/10 in my book.    P.S. If you like these reviews and want to see more of the same, you're more than welcome to follow my curator page.

{"review":"There are only 5 or so games, films, or TV shows that have moved me as much as this game, Life Is Strange has. It is a hard feeling to deal with. The characters feel very real. You come to know many of them, and love them almost like real friends. Then the game is over, and those characters are gone. This causes a hurt inside you. Very much like losing dear friends, because there is no continuation for these characters.  This game is VERY emotional and deals with some very dark, and unfortunately very real things in our world. If you feel for other people, and nature, and the things only humans can cause, whether they are good or bad, this game might make you feel very sad at times, because it puts these things right in your face.  I cried so many times going through this game. I'm a pretty emotional person, but I think these feelings are totally intentional, and so I think the people who made this game did a damn good job. I wish to explore that world and those characters forever, because they seem that real. But, you can't. Much like the themes in this game about how little control we all have over time and events we can't foresee, this game ends and I have to find a way to move on.  The world in this game is pretty to look at. The graphics aren't amazing, but they are done in an artistic way that reminds me of watercolors or something. The gameplay is very similar to Telltale Games style, in that it is mostly walking around areas interacting with a limited number of objects, and talking to other characters. The real point of the game is the storytelling, and they do SUCH a good job in this one, as I've been over and over here.  I would recommend that if you do play it, take it slow, take long breaks if you need them. I took almost a year break and then several week breaks in between some parts, and it is still messing with me that I can't see anything more from these characters. Only replay the game again. Which, much like replaying a moment in the game with the unique rewinding power, only allows me to see that world again, and not live in it forever.  This review isn't much of a review, I know. But I don't want to reveal much and I just wanted to put my thoughts on this game out there somehow, even just to help me get through it. Thanks for reading if you do, though, and I hope you can enjoy this game that it seems to me a lot of work and love went into. :)","hours":45.7,"funny_percent":0.030973451327433628,"helpful_percent":0.9203539823008849}
{"review":"Life is Strange is a work of art. This episodic graphic adventure features characteristics resembling those of a masterpiece. The game brilliantly displays the most impacting voice acting conveying the idea that it is real. The soundtrack that the game offers soothes the mind and works with the story beautifully. Every action and every decision that the player makes has consequences and there exists nothing that is excluded. This piece leaves the player with an experience that is unforgetable, one that will surely impact the way the player thinks from after they complete the game. The game not only presents graphics uniquely with a new way of expressing visuals, but also something that seems as if it was hand-drawn. The characteristics of the plot strike the player with such force that time is required to ponder over the elements of its development. The plot clearly exemplifies signs of originality, and the impression that things are not what they seem is boldly demonstrated. In addition, the game does a solid job at developing a crucial relationship between the characters and the player, leaving the player guilty or satisfied based on their decisions made. Life is Strange is the remark of the year of 2015, boldly establishing its place as one of the best games in history. I believe everyone deserves the oppurtunity to play this work of life lessons and morals, establishing its name as a game for everyone. Life is Strange is DONTNOD Entertainment's masterpiece, and nothing less. Life is very strange.","hours":20.5,"funny_percent":0.018779342723004695,"helpful_percent":0.9248826291079812}
{"review":"December 23, 2015 A friend of mine sent me a gift code for Humble Square Enix Bundle 3. I was delighted. The Bundle had several games, such as Murdered: Soul Suspect, The Last Remnant, 3 Tomb Raiders, and the first episode for this game called Life is Strange. Not gonna lie I've been trying to get my hands on this game for a while but I always ended up buying other games (oh, I wish I could go back in time to buy Life is Strange, instead of those games).  December 24, 2015 Oh, What the hell!? I'm gonna buy the rest of the episodes for Life is Strange. I don't care, it's Christmas Eve. It's a little gift from me to myself. I can't wait for the holidays to pass so I can finally start to play this game.  December 25, 2015 Alright, the time has come. The time to start this epic journey, hopefully, alongside with Max and Chloe. It's been so long since I first saw this game on the store, and yet I don't really know what to expect from this game. Like at all. I don't know what the story is about. Time to play it, finally!  December 26, 2015 Today I played the first and the second episode of Life is Strange, and oh man, now I really wish I would have bought this game earlier, instead of all those other games. The story just started and I already feel such a strong connection to the characters. I don't think that any other game made me feel like this. Better continue this story, I'm so intrigued about what's gonna happen next. Can't wait to play it. P.S.: Always go with Eggs and Bacon!  December 27, 2015 Holy Crap.. This game is getting tougher and tougher, emotionally speaking. What the hell is going on? Today I only could finish the 3rd Episode, and I can ensure you this is getting darker and darker. I'm at the point where the decisions are getting harder and they start to have a great weight on the story. Although I know Max can fix this situation, that ending just left me heartbroken. I haven't even finished the game yet and I can't stop thinking about it. Goddamn it.  December 28, 2015 I lacked courage and strenght to go through these last episodes, call me whatever you want, but this game took a toll on me. When I finally did it, I can say that I have never felt like this before. I think the correct word is desolated, yeah, I feel desolated.  The story is absolutely beautiful, it has many twists, and the characters are so well developed that you can easily create special bonds with almost everyone. Graphically the game is beautiful as well, take your time to appreciate the little details. Obviously I will not spoil you, but be aware, this game has no good ending. It has a bad ending and a worse ending. I took the ending, that I consider to be the bad ending (morally speaking), and it doesn't make me feel that bad. Afterall, friends are for life, right?  December 30, 2015 Two days have passed since I finished the game, and I still can't stop thinking about it. Sometimes I find myself reading Max's diary, and looking at screenshots and artwork of the game.  I have to play it a second time to complete it, but it's still to soon, I have to recover first. I can't make Max go through all that again. I had no idea that a game could make such impact on a person. This is one of my favorite games and I recommend everyone to play it.

{"review":"This game features high school related drama from the perspective of a teenage girl. However the writing, art design, and atmosphere is done so well it will win you over. It tells a very human story while exploring the supernatural. The characters you interact with are entertaining and the story has a lot of heart to it. You are given the opportunity to make several decisions that will impact future episodes, which gives you significant input over the direction of the story. The time travel mechanic is used so well in this game as you try to solve puzzles, rewinding time to manipulate people and objects to your advantage. $5 for the first episode, well that's ok.

{"review":"Everyone has that one tv show that they realise is in some ways not very good, but which they can't help but love anyway. These guilty pleasures are successful generally not on the merit of their content, but on their ability to make you comfortable within their created world. For me, Life is Strange is the perfect example of guilty pleasure gaming.  The one part of Life is Strange that can be enjoyed guilt-free is the story. Life is Strange is the story of Max Caulfield (a photography student attending art school in her old hometown) and her childhood friend Chloe (a tough-talking punk who's shot to death in the school bathroom during the game's opening). Shocked and grief-stricken by her friend's death, Max spontaneously develops time-rewind powers and helps Chloe escape unharmed. Those powers are the central focus of Life is Strange's gameplay, letting you reverse time to test out different responses to tough decisions, or sneak into a locked room and then rewind to erase any evidence of your intrusion.   It's a simple idea that's easy to grasp and fun to experiment with, with results ranging from hilarious (when Max successfully guesses how much change Chloe has in her pockets) to horrifying (when a drug dealer gets angry and flashes a knife in Max's face). In terms of how much those decisions mean in the end, Life is Strange falls somewhere between The Walking Dead and Dragon Age - your choices do have a major impact on events that happen throughout the game and are mentioned later on, but the final decision happens the way it does no matter what. It's the framing and the conversations around it that change.  When you're not time-turning, Life is Strange plays out like many adventure games that came before it: you interact with different objects in the environment that range from plot-critical to merely decorative, and have conversations with your peers and teachers to get the full story of Arcadia Bay. It's not ground-breaking stuff, but entertaining enough, and works to consistently give the world depth and a sense that it doesn't all revolve around you.  Encompassing time travel, investigation, and the dynamics of friendship, Max’s adventures weave a fascinating multi-layered narrative. Though the setup is a touch heavy-handed in the first episode, the search for Rachel becomes a fantastic impetus for the story in later episodes, acting as a platform from which to mix in all the game’s other narrative threads.  While being able to rewind time theoretically might make your decisions feel less impactful, it actually adds a new level of thoughtfulness to an otherwise familiar choice-based system. The decisions you make are legitimately tough, often with long-term consequences that you can't see until it's too late, leaving you anxious and uncertain, regardless of Max's powers. When Chloe's stepfather slaps her across the face because he found her holding drugs, you can go back and claim they're yours, but what trouble will that cause down the road? Will he refuse to help you later when you desperately need it? In a way it helps you identify with Max even more, putting you in the same position of uncertainty she regularly finds herself in.  All of this character-building is bolstered by gorgeous art and music that give life to the game's world. Given how little you see of the actual town (the story is relegated to Blackwell Academy, Chloe's house, a diner, and some uninhabited areas out in the wilderness), making you feel a real connection to it is no small feat, and Life is Strange pulls it off gracefully. Rather than using a real-world setting for the sole purpose of contrasting with its supernatural elements, Life is Strange wants to highlight beauty in the ordinary.   Every chapter has at least one place where Max can take a break and watch the world go by, and the game pays careful attention to making even the smallest pieces of the environment feel real, from the ambient noise of the Two Whales Diner to the things Chloe's written on her bedroom posters. You get the sense that this world isn't just a backdrop for something else, but a fully-realized character of its own, and that makes the time you spend there much more fulfilling.  Of course, friendship and watching the leaves turn isn't all there is to Life is Strange: there's also a detective story, a thriller plot, and a meditation on the effects of time travel that the game tries to handle all at once. That's a lot of balls to keep in the air, and Life is Strange doesn't have the finesse to pull it off. Though its slice-of-life story is appropriately lighthearted and its mystery is replete with strong twists, the supernatural plot falls back on sci-fi clichés and brings the whole story down with it. This is especially obvious in the game's conclusion, which struggles to explain the nature of Max's powers and ultimately takes the easy route with one of the oldest tricks in the time travel book.   It takes a lot to make a game feel worthwhile when it doesn't stick the landing, but Life is Strange has a saving grace: the honesty with which it portrays the painful struggles of adolescence. Max encounters everything from cyber-bullying to suicide, from overdose to domestic abuse, and getting to see the human toll through her eyes can be hard to handle. While the plot occasionally dips into after-school-special territory, 99% of the time its handling is spot-on and deeply affecting: even if you've never seen a friend's private photos leaked onto the internet or talked to someone so beaten down by depression that they can barely speak, Life is Strange's raw sincerity still hits you where it hurts. That's part of why Max and Chloe's relationship feels so powerful, and works so well as a central pillar of the story: when they use Max's powers to sneak into the school's swimming pool after hours, or have a blow-out fight that leaves them both vulnerable, their interactions feel effortless and genuine, making them into stronger, more engaging people.  These sequences are subjective by their very nature - the psychological abuse that one person finds cheesy could be devastating to the person sitting next to them - and the game doesn't always handle them gracefully. However, these moments are less about the reality of being a teenager (some things are out of your control) and more about how it feels to be a teenager (I should have done something). In that regard Life is Strange hits it out of the park: it takes risks, talking about the transition into adulthood in a frank way that games struggle to pull off, if they try at all. And in putting its characters out there at their most vulnerable, it hits a nerve that'll still sting hours, days, weeks after you turn the game off.  There's a lot Life is Strange could have done better. It comes to a disappointing conclusion, doesn't handle all of its intense subject matter well, and ultimately falls short of its potential. Even so, with each episode, the world of Life is Strange grows on you. Your investment in the world rises, and the tonal problems become less of a barrier to enjoyment and more just quirks of this lovably flawed universe. It becomes like that soap that you need to watch; the problems quickly become secondary to your desire to find out what happens next, or your desire just to spend time with the characters.   In fact, some of the best moments of the game are Max and Chloe just hanging out. These quiet moments allow you to connect to these characters in a way rarely explored in games. So despite its issues, Life is Strange is absolutely an experience worth having. In the end, its flaws are merely speedbumps, small irritations in the fascinating and unique experience the game has to offer. A guilty pleasure indeed.","hours":165.3,"funny_percent":0.018404907975460124,"helpful_percent":0.9202453987730062}
