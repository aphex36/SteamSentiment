Ok, so I have played A LOT of this game so i feel that i'm justified in saying  that this game is FANTASTIC. In this review i will go through the pros and cons  of purchasing this game. I am trying to come from a perspective of someone who  has played this game since 2008, I have purchased this game 4 times, for Xbox  360, PS3, Retail Box and Steam. Over the 4 versions of the game I would say that  I have played a good 1000 hours. Yet I keep coming back for some reason. Cod4 is  one of the games that I play each and every day. I mostly play Promod, but I dip  into Non-modded every now and then.  Pros: Mod Support, many, many mods for this game. There is a whole separate game of  just mods. To name a few there is Prop Hunt, Promod, One in the chamber and a  multitude of others. Smooth uninterrupted game play, I wish more games had this these days. From the ground up this game was made to be as smooth as possible.  Developer Console, this is a biggy in my books. Not enough games these days have this. This is the command line that you can use to edit any settings that you would like, you can load maps, change  Sensitivity aswell as other settings such as FOV and maxfps. With commands like cg_fov 80 and  com_maxfps 250.  Cons: There are very few cons for this game. Some of the biggest and most prevalent are  the aim botters and silent aim users. If anything this is what will send you over  the edge. Another thing is that most of the servers are unpopulated. Don’t get me wrong,  there is still a huge player base in CoD4. Its just that I wish there were more.  Thank you for reading this review and I hope that it will influence your purchase  in a good way. Cheers, Virconium","hours":550.1}

I just want to confirm this for people wondering if this game is still alive. It totally is! Even after a decade, there are a TONNE of servers active with many players still playing on them. You dont need to download any mods or patches to make it work, nor do you need to even touch punkbuster. Not every single server will work because some require maps/files you may not have, but upon failing to connect, they usually give you a link to the site you can get them from. As for vanilla maps / gamemodes, this totally works!! No CD key ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, just select a server and connect! Leveling up your rank also functions just fine. In a single 30min TDM i ranked up a couple times so im not entirely sure if it was always that fast or if the server had boosted rates but it hardly matters as your rank is linked to a file on your PC. If you so choose, you can download a MP profile that has everything unlocked, or just enjoy ranking normally.   If you know how, you can also port forward and host a live or dedicated server for you and friends right from the game's multiplayer menu. You can even make it public (show up on server browser) for others to join.  As for the single player aspect. It's one of the best of the series (story and gameplay wise). I've played Counterstrike for multiple years and often refused to get sunked into a CoD game despite trying many of them due to their weak 'feel good' style of gameplay katered towards a smaller skill gap however CoD4 has been the only exception for me, putting hundreds of hours on Xbox 360 souly for this game many years back. I've run through the story at least 5 times and enjoyed it every time since. It's dramatic, slightly cheesy at times but overall told very well and have solid characters you surely will get attached to. The system req's are quite low as well so nearly any PC from 06 with a 128mb GPU and Pentium 4 will be able to run this game at a solid 60.   I'd strongly reccomend this game considering the community is still very much active. Even when the master server goes down, many 3rd party websites offer lists of live IP's you can directly connect to without the use of the server browser. $10 is totally worth it, I couldn't be happier.","hours":12.4}

I think many will agree with me on that. i have less than 100 hours simply since i have nobody to play online with,and that i played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it on ps3 and nintendo wii. and then spent even more hours making montages i would fail at.  One of the best single players mode out there,with a neat arcade mode and cheats to use. so it has a lot more replayablity compared most other cods(espeically more recent ones).  But the mutiplayer is what really makes this game and thankfully there is plently of servers still online on PC(including fun mod ones). so the game may be dead on consoles,but on PC its worth playing. Also joining a match is pretty quick, almost instant so if you want instant action,well there you go.The gameplay style is more simple,but with enough perks and attachments to keep it from being boring,and i think it all comes down to weapon balance and pretty much every weapon in this game is useful. you can do well with almost any weapon.  So yeah the only negative is the price,its pretty fixed at 20 bucks and sales are extrememly rare,and thats coming from someone who spent hundreds of hours on. just be aware the community is much smaller and finding a decent server will take some trial and error. 9/10 its like skyrim but with modern warfare","hours":231.4}

The core gameplay, like beating the campaign & epiologue on veteran, or replaying the gun course to beat the dev time for the bazillionth time is alot of fun. The MP experience is after all this time pretty decent too. Thanks to good maps, dedicated servers and fast paced action without too much customization.

{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.9702607119154539,"review":"One of the best games of the franchise, the highly acclaimed Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a must have for a fan of the Call of Duty games. The games single player experience is phenomonal. From the beginning raid on the Russian tanker, to the cataclysmic end to the U.S campaign, to the brilliant All Ghillied Up mission, the game will keep you hooked, followed by a story that is believable, but not over the top compared to the future releases in the franchise.  The Multiplayer is where Call of Duty shines however, and Cod 4 is a thoroughly enjoyable experience but not without flaws due to a variety of reasons at this point in time. When Cod 4 was released, the game included many new features not seen in previous Call of Duty games, such as the now standard Create a Class, Killstreaks etc, all of which feel balanced and nothing too overpowered (except maybe the P90). Where the PC version differs to the console versions is the player count. Cod 4 supports up to 48 players per server and sometimes it's absolute madness, just like the old Call of Duty days. Make no mistake, it's still a really enjoyable experience but console players may find it somewhat jarring coming from console to PC but you can always join a server with less players. There is no Prestige, with ranks taking longer to achieve in its place, and dedicated servers are there which mean less lag compared to the console version.  BUT unfortunately, as 2013, Cod 4's server browser and online experience is somewhat annoying. A LOT of servers which turn up in the browser have this annoying redirect mod, which you have to install. This means what may show up as Backlot, standard, TDM, 40 players may redirect you to a Hardcore, S&D, 3 player game. It's frustrating at times to find a decent game.   All in all, the game is highly recommended and along with the original Cod, UO and Cod 2. Probably the last GREAT Cod, with future games removing much of the standard PC features and instead being a console port. Buy it.","hours":5.3}

Cons: - Sometimes the AI can be a bit annoying. - Yea I think this is the only cons about the singleplayer.  ---  Multiplayer  Pros:  +Very good designed maps. +Very simple class system. +The community is still alive. +Only 3 killstreaks that is really nice imo (UAV, Airstrike and chopper). +Fun challenges. +You can add mods to the multiplayer like “promod”.  Cons: -There is some unbalance perks. -Grenade spam can be a huge problem on high player servers. -Spawnkilling can be a huge problem sometimes when your opponents knows what they are doing. -On some servers it require to have the anti-cheat software “Punkbuster” installed, And sometimes for some users the software gets disabled every time they boot up the game (Not a huge problem).  ---  Overall:  Pros: +Good game for a very good price. +You can play this game on almost every mid-gen system. +You get that you pay for (That will say you get a very good single & multiplayer experience).
