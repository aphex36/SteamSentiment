But I'm getting ahead of myself. The Stanly Parable is, at it's heart, a parody of Video Game (and general) narration tropes. However the point the Stanley Parable tries to make is that narration, as done in most other linear mediums, can't (and furthermore SHOULDN'T) be handled the same way in video games, because the player controls the action and pacing (and sometimes the outcome) of the story in video games. even in completely railroaded and highly linear First-Person Shooters you can still decide to just stand in a corner for 10 hours and not do anything, which would obviously break up the narrative flow of any story.  The Stanley Parable instead delivers a reactive story, one that adapts to any and all choices the player makes. You can decide to follow the narrator's instructions and get a totally boring and clich√©d ending, or you can decide to stand in the broom closet for 15 minutes and look at a bucket. Both are narrated.  In Short if you are interested in a game that's NOT just a AAA linear movie-esque railroad, but want to see a game that perfect utilizes it'S medium, this game is for you.","hours":2.8}

This is gonna be long, so bare with me.   The Stanley Parable is a game like no other. You play as Stanley, a man who works in an office and pushes buttons for a living. One day you look up and see that everyone in the office has disappeared...  As you wander around the office, a narrator narrates everthing you do. EVERYTHING.  \"Stanley wandered around touching everything the office, but there was nothing to be found\" \"Stanley stepped into the broom closet, even though there was nothing there.\" \"Stanley continued down the hallway even though he knew it would lead to his violent death.\"  As you come to rooms with multiple paths, the narrator will tell you what path to take. You choose whether to obey him or not. If you continue to disobey him, the narrator becomes angry with you and reacts differently depending on what you have done. The narrator is hilarious when you aggravate him! He breaks the fourth wall many times, stating that he knows he's in a video game.   I also really like how much there is to explore in the game. While it may feel confined, if you truly think outside the box there are tons of things to discover. Hidden rooms, narrator soliloquies, and other secrets are everywhere. Even when you think you glitched the game, the narrator scolds you for trying to break his masterpiece. Not to mention there are about 20 endings to the game to discover. (Some are very hard to find though.)   I think the price is a bit high for the game, so try to get it on sale. I got it for $4 and it is definitely worth a few bucks more than that. (Maybe not $15 though.)  Overall, this game is one of my favorites. It's hilarious and your mind will be blown as you try to wrap your head around some of the paradoxes in it.

He had to make a choice: to recommend the game, or to not recommend the game.  Stanley enjoyed the game: its story was unique, and although the base gameplay was more or less the same as the Half-Life mod upon which it was based, the endings were new and even the ones that weren't still deviated from expectations.  On the other hand, Stanley was aware that the game was short, and once all the endings were reached he found himself uninterested in returning. Additionally, if Stanley wanted, he could find a multitude of Youtube videos that showed everything in the game for free.  In the end, Stanley decided to recommend the game. He felt that the unique qualities of the storytelling created a game that must be experienced to fully enjoy, and he wanted others to try the game and support the developers. He also wanted this genre of game to flourish, so more unique experience could develop.","hours":8.7}

The writing is clever, and the narration is charming, while also managing to be just a little unsettling. It's a game, so much in that you control movement and press buttons. But there isn't any combat, and the freedom of choice is just an illusion (which is kinda the point). It's meant to be played over and over again, just to see the different reactions you can get from the game. And there are many many reactions to find.  And if this doesn't sound like something you'd want to spend any time with, you can always treat it like a really obscure easter egg hunt. Because there's a ton of those too. If you are like me, and you try to break a game just for fun, you might find out that this game considers it a legitimate storytelling branch.  And if that doesn't sell it to you either, you can consider it a narrator annoyance simulator. It's something for everyone, provided you like these three things.","hours":2.9}

Well you play Stanley, who works in an office. And one day Stanley realises everyone else has disappeared and it is up to him to find out why ... or is it?

{"funny_percent":0.11254019292604502,"helpful_percent":0.9862715288773913,"review":"Overview The Stanley Parable is a one of a kind game. You play as Stanley, an employee that has to press buttons. When suddenly, you stop and head out your office. A narrator describes your adventure and it's up to you to listen to him or not. Explore the office building and make different choices every playthrough and unlock all of the many endings possible!  The Pros: Beautiful - The graphics are decent, the lightning glorious, and walking through the building is pleasant to the eye.  Choices - The best thing a game can do for you is let you be in control. The Stanley Parable makes you make your own story, every step of the way, and unlocking a different ending every time. Such decisions include taking the left or right door, going to the meeting or not, or turning off the evil machine... or not. Every action has a thing to say for the ending.  Comical - The narrator says things that are sometimes very funny, the way he reacts when you disobey him and the scenes you encounter have some very rich monologue.  Deep - It might not look like this the first time you play, but as you uncover different endings you will see the hidden meaning behind Stanley's story. The writing is very cleverly done, the existance of the narrator poses further questions, and the very nature of reality bends amongst different endings.  The Cons: Repetitive up to a point - As the story forks at different intersections, you are bound to repeat parts of it until you reach the branching point. Some of the paths require waiting for long narrations to play, so you might become a little impatient along the process.  Unconventional Achievements - Most achievements require a degree of witt to figure out what they want (or read a guide) but there are some that are really unnecessary, such as playing the game for the entire duration of a Tuesday, implying either BIOS Time Changing or leaving the PC idle for 24 hours, the Unachiveable, which requires configuration file tweaks and the Go Outside which makes you not play for... 5 years. Of course, circumventable with a little sly techniques, but they are not achievements related to the game. They don't track progress or skill, they're just there to mess with you and waste your time.  Conclusion: The Stanley Parable stand out amongst the rest of pshycological narratives and really puts the player in a position of power over his destiny, or at least gives him a very powerful delusion about it.

The concept of this game is great to me.  You play as Stanley. A man who works in a mundane job pushing buttons all day. Orders come through to his screen to push buttons and he does as told. One day, Stanley realises no orders are coming through, and that no one else is in the office. He gets up to see what‚Äôs going on.  That‚Äôs where we come in! You navigate Stanley around a very seemingly linear office, and quickly discover that you have a narrator dictating everything that you do, before you do it. Of course, leaving you room to either play out what he says, or go against it. You come to various paths and crossroads and are given the choice to either do what you‚Äôre told or not.  What I love about this game is how it plays on pure human curiosity. If you go one way, you usually wonder‚Ä¶ but what would happen if I went the other way? There is many endings to the game, and as the narrator goes on with his story, you wonder what is true. If anything you‚Äôre being told is true, what the real story to the game is or if there even is one. It gets you thinking, and I love a game that‚Äôll make me think!  I enjoyed this game very much. I have an odd ‚Äúfear‚Äù, kind of, of missing or losing things. So being given a game with many paths, endings and different things to find, admittedly I did OCD over it a bit and actually went as far as drawing myself a map (Don‚Äôt judge me). But it was a lot of fun! I had a great time playing this game and think it is something anyone could enjoy.   The graphics are nice. I wasn‚Äôt aware before, but this game actually started as a Half-Life 2 mod. As a standalone game I think it did really well for itself.  The characters are amazing. I love both Stanley, the narrator and the odd ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù they have with each other (Even though Stanley never speaks). The voice casting for the narrator is on point, I honestly couldn‚Äôt imagine the character any other way. He‚Äôs well-spoken and has a great charm about him. The narrator in ways kind of ‚Äútrolls‚Äù you a bit with how he tries to keep you on track or how he reacts when you go against him. But he‚Äôs a great character and that is important for a game so dependent on that character being entertaining.   The humour in this game was something I did enjoy quite a bit. The way things are done and played out I was quite impressed with.   In terms of achievements, a few can be a little tedious, but in ways you ain‚Äôt even mad. As said before the game can ‚Äútroll‚Äù you at times and it does so even more through the achievements. I would say that it‚Äôs still easy to 100%, but there is a few that you kind of need to ‚Äúcheat‚Äù to achievement. For example, an achievement titled ‚ÄúGo outside‚Äù, your task being to ‚Äúnot play The Stanley Parable for 5 years‚Äù. Which, come on!  All in all, I love this game and really think you should give it a try. If you like a good bit of humour and like your curiosity being tempted I think this game is a good one for that.   TL ; DR : A great and unique game that tests your curiosity and gets you thinking. It has many endings to offer and generally is fun, definitely try it! ","hours":51.1}

You play as employee number 427; an employee who only pushes buttons as per the instructions of his superiors. Stanley, however, does not receive any orders one day, therefore, he gets up from his desk and starts investigating what exactly has happened.  And this is where you take control of him in this FPS which uses the well-known game engine called Source. Our protagonist immediately notices that nobody else is present in the office - he passes empty cubicles and corridors trying to find the answers.  There are no weapons in this game. No NPCs you can interact with. No objectives. No goals. Stanley Parable is about exploration. And this exploration, this journey of our white-collar worker is accompanied by the narrator's voice.  However, you will notice that the narrator tells Stanley, in advance, which door he is supposed to take. But you can refuse the command and go to the direction you desire. And this is the most crucial part of this game: it is about choices. Your choices.  And these choices can yield you at least a dozen endings. Endings that are funny, serious, sarcastic and some are even meant to be no more than mere easter eggs.  This is not something you'll spend dozens of hours with.

Stanley works in a dead end job carrying out mindless tasks; and the story is told by one of the best narratives I have ever heard. Graphics isn't an important feature here, but that being said, it looks really nice.   The design of the world is very well done, you are essentially in an office building, but it does a very clever thing where you can sometimes be walking around in a circle, and then all of a sudden the world changes, and you are somewhere else. This made the experience feel more real to me. You can make this game as easy or as difficult as you want. There is fifteen different stories and endings to the Stanley Parable, each of them is amazingly written, probably one of, if not the best story in gaming I've experienced and well worth playing.

You actually dont challenge for anything and it has nearly 20 different endings. All of these endings just take 1 and a half hour only. You just relax, explore and listen. You will laugh some times, at least smile if you are not in a good mood. Graphics are above ok.   Summary: A funny parable. Must buy on sale.","hours":2.1}
