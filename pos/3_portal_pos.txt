If -- like me -- you are late to the party and have yet to play the game, this review is for you... and hey, there's CAKE!  There are tabs for the various options:  - Keyboard, where you can re-map keys - Mouse, where you can enable the controller - Audio, with separate sliders for Game & Music. Subtitles are NOT the default. I highly suggest turning them on, as the mechanical voice is hard to understand. - Video, where you can choose Full Screen vs. Windowed, Aspect Ratio, Brightness, Advanced, and Resolution (up to 1920x1080)  I was happy to find that the game is mostly controller-compatible... The crouch function doesn't seem to be mapped, so if you're going to use a gamepad, use the Ctrl button on your keyboard to crouch ;)  The concept is simple enough. You (will) have two guns, one that produces a blue portal, and one that gives you an orange portal. In one, out the other. Solve puzzles and move on to the next area. Easy right?  Well... Yes and no. The portals themselves aren't difficult to figure out, but you have to master the physics involved to truly progress in the game. I had a hell of a time grasping the this point because I was so disoriented when I was falling. Here's a hint: You need to gain some momentum if you want to make some distance when you exit the second portal, and oft times that means falling -- not just jumping -- through a portal.   There is some platforming involved, and a variety of obstacles (of course, what kind of game would this be if there weren't obstacles?) in your way, both benign and deadly, and through it all is your ever-present narrator-guide. I don't recommend muting her, as you'll miss out on both the ambience and a huge part of the story if you do (subtitles alone just aren't the same~).  But.. what story? O_o The game is tagged story-rich, so I was surprised to find that there wasn't much of a story at all! Sure it was interesting, but story-rich? But then... finally... It all changed. Sure it was something I was expecting, but things didn't pan out exactly how I had anticipated, either.  You will have to get through 11 chapters before approaching the end of the game, and as you complete each chapter, the Developer Commentary becomes available (accessible via the main menu.) Whilst you're in commentary mode, you can't be damaged, but you also won't gain achievements.  Speaking of achievements, there are 15 to be had, and only 1/3 of them can be gained by playing through the game. There are Advanced Chambers and Challenges available via the Bonus Maps section which is where you'll earn the bulk of your achievements.  It's easy to see the influences that this game has had on modern gaming, especially games like The Talos Principle. Portal is on the short side, but well worth playing if you enjoy puzzle-adventures, especially if you plan on playing Portal 2.","hours":8.6}

In terms of video games: it is the very definition of short & sweet. There are many people out there overly concerned with the length of games, and I believe Portal is an excellent example of why one shouldn’t immediately scoff at a short game due to prejudices. Sometimes 3 hours of perfection is better than 20 hours of mediocrity. Sit down, immerse yourself, and just play through the game in one sitting as you would if watching a movie. It is worth it.  I say this because I believe this is a game best enjoyed in one sitting. There are no lulls or down points, and every second of the game is riveting and purposeful. The whole experience is so genuinely entertaining and the pacing is so perfectly on point that I think it is designed to be played like this. In this way, I see the length of the game as a strength and not a weakness… but maybe I’m just crazy.  But what is it that makes the game so genuinely entertaining in the first place? Everything… and then some. The concept is innovative, the puzzles are intuitive and interesting, the atmosphere is captivating, and the dialogue is hilarious and flawless. And when all of these facets come together in the finished product, the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. And a game is created that transcends opinions: it is undeniably great.  Honestly, I respect everyone’s right to their own taste in video games; but if you don’t enjoy Portal, I would dutifully suggest you consider finding a new hobby. I would find it very hard to understand how anyone could possibly not enjoy this game if they consider themselves a “gamer.”  If you haven’t yet had the luxury of experiencing Portal, then I envy you.

The player wakes up in a glass room , the Aperture Science development center, where he is subjected to a series of experiments until ...... well I will not spoil the game .... Each experiment is guided by Glados voice, the mainframe development center computer. Glados is one of the best virtual characters in recent years. That computer has more personality than many humans from other games.  Throughout the game the player acquires a portal gun. This gun allows you to create portals, to enter and exit portals in order to go forward in the game, which requires solving logic puzzles to advance. You will acquire a good sense of physics, position and movement.  The game is a marvel of Valves creativity. Many would prefer to kill zombies in left 4 dead , but personally, I think games like Portal are those who write history. The game lasts a few hours and when it finishes, with music and lyrics, it makes you want to stand and applaud. No other game in recent years has touched me so much when it ended. It is an ode to creativity.  Its sequel , Portal 2, expands the concept of the game and makes it much longer, making it a standalone game. The Portal 2 was named Game of the Year in 2011 for various publications.  The game was released for Windows PC , PS3 and XBOX 360 before being ported to MAC OSX.

Quizas muchos prefieran matar zombies como en el left 4 dead, pero personalmente creo que juegos como el Portal son los que escriben la historia.

Portal is a first person puzzle game. It was a great game when it came out, it's a great game even now. Even if you don't play puzzle games, you should still give it a try. The puzzles aren't too difficult. The game slowly introduces new mechanic so that it's really easy to grasp. And solving the puzzles are soooooo satisfying!   What's more? It's a puzzle game that has a great background story and although there is only one character other than the main protagonist, it's one of the best NPC in video game history.

I'm not sure if this has mods like its sequel - nevertheless, it's worth completing this one before moving on to the next as the puzzles are even more difficult and diverse in Portal 2.  I like how the game has a background story while it would not be necessary, at all. It has an excellent antagonist in the form of an A.I. called GLaDOS.  Portal is a memorable experience and if you liked Half-Life you should pick up this Valve product, as well.  Oh, you didn't like Half-Life?

It's quirky at best, but it also remains clever, resolute and perfectly presented to those with likings for a quick-wit and a scientific explanation for including physics in a well-thought out and intelligent game, all with a touch of dark humour. It's quite rare to see a Steam user with a huge game library that doesn't include Portal nowadays. Heck, this game was my very first purchase.  You awaken in the deserted Enrichment Center of Aperture Laboratories; a fictional science research corporation, located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Known for the creation of the handheld portal gun, as well as the heavy rivalry the complex has between the Black Mesa Research Facility. (The scientific complex focused in Half-Life. Half-Life and Portal both share the same universe.) in Portal, you play as the silent protagonist, Chell, from a first-person perspective as you are challenged to navigate through a series of cryptic chambers, all the while being accompanied by the voice of the Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System (GlaDOS for short.) which the sociopathic robot subsequently reveals the rest of the plot to the player, through various and long-winded narration throughout the game. And what is this reward you get for all this mind-wrecking work? Why it's none other than cake!   While on the subject of sweet chocolate butter-milk frosting, assembled with maraschino cherries on top, this all turns out to be a crude lie, and you're sent to be burnt to a crisp by GlaDOS. As you narrowly escape death, you navigate through the many things that Aperture Laboratories would have wanted to keep as a secret to the rest of the world. You soon (or later, as this game has a way of messing with your head.) find yourself exploring the air vents, empty corners with obscure writings on the wall, the sewers of the facility, as well as the abandoned, deserted offices of those who mysteriously left the complex, along with empty food supplies and crude drawings that uncovers a much darker history of the laboratories.  What strikes me most surprised is this game's ingenius concept and profound knowledge of linear momentum and physics. Your only weapon in the game, if you can call it a weapon, is the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. It's main and only ability is to create two distinct portals, an orange and blue portal, which both create a visual and physical connection between two different locations in three-dimensional space. Keep in mind that neither portal are both an entrance or an exit; all objects that travel through one portal will exit through the other. This unique concept will soon be taken to the test, as you explore, solve and escape through 19 mind-wrecking chambers all the while keeping your distance both far and dangerously close to heavily armed turret bots.  But, you're not alone in this deranged prison of a laboratory, your square-buddy (and probably only buddy.) known as the Companion Cube, will accompany you throughout a few of these chambers, as it has a handful of most needed traits; involving you using it as an extra step for those hard-to-reach places, using it as a shield against deadly laser spheres and deflecting them into switch mechanisms, and even going as so far to hold out weight-activated button switches. Sadly, with every chamber completed thanks to your Companion Cube, you will have to eventually abandon it and leave it for trash, in the Emergency Intelligence Incinerator. What a true friend to the end!  When cracking down to the lifespan of this game's story, it's actually pretty short. But, with each new chamber you progress through as well as the difficulty beginning to rise at a much faster pace, the longer the chambers will begin to mess with your head and could leave you stuck for a good couple of hours, completely stumped. I'm guilty to say that I even needed a guide to deal with a couple of these cryptic and twisted chambers. But then again, that really ruined the experience for me a little, considering I like to figure things out much more independently. So, if you can unwrap things around your mind quick and efficiently, you may experience the amazement and creativity for yourself. I'm pretty jealous in fact.  This game is a big recommendation for me. The scientific aspect of portal and three-dimensional space used in this game is best described as baffling. Valve must have been truly blessed to ever release this game, as it touched the hearts of kids, adults and professional scientists alike.","hours":17.2}
{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.7955797249628997,"review":"Portal is another Grade-A game by the boys at Valve, but is it as god-like as people say.  The Positives  - Very original concept.  - Totaly unique game mechanic.  - Graphics IMO hold up better than some of the other older Source games like CSS or DoD: Source. Play with HDR enabled for the full effect, the lighting is amazing.  - A very subtle story that is not told really throught the main game but more through the many secrets hiding behild the pearly white walls of Apeture Science.  - The game can get challenging, but not really in the unfair way, this game requires you to think things through and to take your time, it is a puzzle game after all.  - For the most part the game has great pacing, there are only 1 or 2 spots in the game where I feel the game slows to a crawl or feels tedious.  - The game is easy to pickup and play, and after your first or second playthrough you could easily breeze through the game like it was nothing.  The Negatives  - After chamber 13, the game's difficulty spikes up unexpectingly, so for your first playthrough it can be a bit of a shock.  - The last chapter in the game is a bit too long. They buildup the confrontation of GLados alot. And in the last chapter the puzzle are not really hard or too interesting. It kinda kills the pacing for me, I would not have a problem with the game slowing down a bit at the end to build hype, but that blends into my next issue.  - The battle with Glados is not hard at all. The payoff for all the stuff you went through is lackluster. Here is how the battle goes. Hit Glados with a rocket, knock off core, grab it, put it in a cremator. Rinse and repeat 3 times and you win. I'm not saying Glados is not an interesting villian, i'm just saying that the fight against it is kinda bad.  - The length of the game is a bit too short. 19 chambers, a chapter dedicated to escaping the test chambers, and a final fight with Glados. That is all you get for the campaign. Even for a first timer like me it will take anywhere from 3-4 hours to beat the game. There is a time attack mode, and some advanced courses, but I will be generous and say they will add another 5 hours of gameplay. You have at the most about 10-11 hours of gameplay. Pitiful for a Valve title.  - The game does not have too much replay value. I bet by your 3rd playthrough you will know each chamber like the back of your hand, and you could plow through the game.  - Screw chamber 19, that is the only unfair hard part of the game for me.  - Ganeraly I think the game is kinda bare bones once you look past the portal mechanics and the pretty aesthetic.  Summary  Overall, I think I can look past some of the glaring flaws, because beyond the few blemishes the game is excellent. It is just a game I would not see myself playing again and again.  I give Portal a very solid 8/10.","hours":4.4}

Aperture Science represents what happens when we decide to treat human beings strictly from a scientific perspective, disregarding the human perspective. Everything, from the distinctly sterline dystopian anti-human environment to the half-insane rebellion of the Ratman and especially the dark humor of Glados, reinforces this central theme of the story. Ultimately, disregarding the human perspective to only consider the scientific perspective will destroy the moral conscience of any humans who do this and lead them to force this on others as well, just as Glados forces Chell to destroy the Companion Cube. (which I think represents the consicence) Portal 2's lack of direct attention to this theme led to it feeling much less cohesive than the original.  Science is no good to us without ethics.

Portal has no life in it at all, and no one else in the game at all (the only enemies you will see are the turrets which are only in very few segments). You can't even see the sky, you are completely trapped and deprived in a colourless building which is why the companion cube, turrets and glados are so memorable because they are the only things you are exposed to in the entire game. Now if this was not done the right way, Portal could have been a very boring game, but since the innovation of the portals and glados and all the other highlights are added in, those things are going to get full attention from the player since nothing else is in focus since everything else is so bleak, which also why the escape sequence is so much fun, because you want to get out of this place and back outside That is ♥♥♥♥ing genius!!!

{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.9096583008747916,"review":"Portal is a first-person puzzle game developed and published by Valve and released in October 2007. You play as Chell, a female protagonist that completes testings for Aperture Science Laboratories. The game features a nineteen level campaign that allows you to solve puzzles. Solving each puzzle progresses you further into the story. This review will discuss the campaign, the levels, and gameplay.  Portal features a solid campaign that provides a good introduction to the world of the Laboratories. The game begins with an in-game tutorial introducing you to the portal gun, the tests and Glados, the antagonist AI computer. Portal excels at storytelling through the slow burn approach to the story. Certain sequences in the story subtly reveal major plot points such as what is Glados planning to do to Chell once she has completed her tests. These subtle hints provide excitement for those who have noticed them as it foreshadows the final scenes in the game. Portal 1 is less about story and more about introducing you to the environment. I get the vibe that this game is more like a prologue to Portal 2 because comparing Portal 1 to Portal 2, P2 expands on the gameplay and environment and emphasises the story whereas P1 introduces you to the setting, the characters, the type of gameplay, and the story. In saying that, I do really like the introduction to the characters as Glados is a refreshing computer personality in which gives the impression that robots control humans, or Glados controls Chell.  The campaign as mentioned includes nineteen levels and these levels are basic. It promotes creativity as the levels progressively become more difficult. However, I feel the majority of the levels are simple and relatively easy compared to the final five levels. The final five levels are challenging and they require more thinking, meaning they encourage more exploration on how to complete it. The levels are of good length. About 10 out of the 19 levels took some time to complete and it lengthened the game and made it more enjoyable because the overall campaign was short at under three hours. Portal features an 'advanced levels' mode which takes the final six levels of the campaign, reworks them and makes them much more difficult to complete. I did not play this mode because I prefer not to replay the same levels with no end goal. Generally though, it does add some variety and lasting appeal to the game for players.  Portal incorporates some vibrant and detailed gameplay, particularly in the portal gun. The portal gun allows you to create two portals that transport you from A to B. Comparatively, Portal 1 delivers on the shooting aspect of the portal gun because when shooting the portal gun there is a visible bullet that travels and it creates a graphics effect when it hits the target. This exceeds the portal gun shooting animations in Portal 2 which once you shoot the gun it automatically hits the target. Furthermore, the portal gun has fitting sound that complements it. I only encountered one issue in the entire game, which is relatively minor, and that is the somewhat less-responsive nature of the controls. For instance, picking up objects would regularly require two clicks on a regular basis and when some levels have timed sections it can become slightly annoying.  Portal has very optimised performance. I played on max settings at something like 200FPS after turning off V-Sync. With V Sync enabled, I managed 50FPS and minimal stuttering.  Conclusion Portal is a very solid game. It introduces you to the robot-run world and the world of testing. The story is fun in that it introduces you to the setting and characters through a slow burn story approach. The game has nineteen levels which I completed in under three hours. There is an advanced levels mode featuring the six final levels in the campaign that are more challenging. I get the notion that Portal is a prologue to Portal 2 as it is establishes all the aspects in the game, which is vastly expanded on in the sequel. In saying that, I enjoyed this first instalment into the Portal series. At USD$9.99 as a standalone product, I recommend it. However, I highly recommend the Portal bundle at USD$22.49 which includes Portal 1 and 2.  Rating Overall: 7/10  Pros - The slow-burn approach to the story. - The gameplay that refreshes the FPS genre. - The very detailed portal gun with excellent animations. - The emphasis of creativity in the levels.  Cons - Length of campaign. - The simplicity in half of the levels.   If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Released in 2007, Portal was an FPS puzzle game developed by Valve. It quickly received critical acclaim for its unique, pioneering gameplay and darkly humoured tone. Set in the Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment centre, the player assumes the role of Chell, a test subject confined within the facility by the rogue AI, GLaDOS.   The game is separated into sequential test chambers which contain various puzzles and hazardous environments which you must navigate through using your hand held portal device. The device allows the player to create inter-spatial portals on level planes, creating visual and physical links between them. Two distinct portals (blue and orange) can be created at any one time in order to fashion an entrance and an exit through which the player and other environmental objects can travel through.  Another significant game mechanic is the concept of momentum being conserved through portals. Players and objects will exit portals with the same speed (and orientation) with which they entered them, allowing players to launch themselves great distances both vertically and horizontally.  The test chambers become increasingly more advanced and hazardous as the game progresses. Light combat elements are present, but you have no direct means of defending yourself. Instead, emphasis is placed on using portals in an evasive manner or as a way to deactivate enemies using environmental props.  Valve developed Portal alongside their Half-Life 2 series using the Source engine. The stark and often Spartan appearance of the test chambers were a conscious design choice to help players focus on the puzzles without distraction, but it also perfectly reflects the concept of a clinical laboratory setting. Despite this minimalist look, the game still looks graphically decent even by today’s standards.  Portal is very light on any form of plot and the story elements are very subtle, coming only from your interactions with GLaDOS and some hidden information caches. However, GLaDOS herself quickly becomes one of the most memorable aspects of Portal. Her script is full of sarcasm and a blatant disregard for your safety, which creates some genuinely humorous dialogue. GLaDOS’ speeches almost become a reward in themselves for completing the puzzles you encounter.  One of the few criticisms that can be levelled at Portal is its length, as it can be comfortably completed in just a few hours. However, it is worth noting that you can unlock several advanced test chambers and additional challenge modes to boost gameplay time. These extra levels really display how Portal is a game which is relatively easy to learn but difficult to master. There is also a developer commentary mode which includes some tracks from Ellen McLain (voice of GLaDOS) if you are at all interested in the development process.  Overall, Portal manages to seamlessly combine unique gameplay mechanics with an intuitive level design. It has a highly polished presentation which still looks good today. It is a genuinely innovative gameplay experience, which deserves every accolade it has collected.","hours":45.6}

Its a fun little puzzle game and has extra puzzles for people that like hard stuff.  Pro: -Fun puzzles. -Great and humorous story. -Extra hard puzzle chambers and challenges. -Very fun to think with portals  Cons: -Short -Some of the puzzle solutions are so obvious its hard to find the solution.

There is literally NOTHING flawed in the game, nothing at all I can think of. The pacing is impeccable, with the correct timing on music and ambient playback with the story. It covers all types of pacing with music and ambience in gameplay, from the slow and depressing downward spiral of thinking you may never escape (Self Esteem Fund from the OST), to the fast paced finale music of the game. The game made me go through so many emotions all in the expanse of my first time playing around 3 hours.  The game is UNBELIEVABLY clever, yet doesn't need to break the fourth wall to do that, which is incredibly impressive. The game's humour is absolutely timeless, it is old as hell (9 years from this review point), and yet the jokes are still brilliant. witty, and dark. There are almost NO games that do it on the same caliber of Portal, hell, not even Portal 2 could live up to this godly creation. The puzzles are beautifully made, completely fair (no fidgety rubbish) and once again, timeless in the sense of enjoyment.   Visually, you might think this game is nothing to write home about, but to me, once again the game shows how age will NEVER affect this game. NEVER. simplistic visuals will always be timeless, intricate wank in videogames will ensure it stays contemporary.  I think I play through Portal 1 at least once a year. The game is short, and scales next to nothing in comparison to other games, but unlike those said games, which take hours upon hours of your life, portal will only take an hour or two. But it stays with you for life, and allows you to experience true perfection in a videogame. I generally hate analogies for this kind of stuff, but if you can think of some other medium with a perfect technicality and timelessness to it (think of Citizen Kane or something), then Portal is that kind of game. I think most people in the year 2016 will have played this by now, but sometimes you just gotta pour your heart out for something you cherish a bunch.  Valve may not be the greatest company, but some small dev adopted by them gave us a glimpse of perfection in a video game format. And for that, I am grateful.","hours":38.9}

This is one of the most brilliant and funny games I have ever played, from start to finish. It's amazing and amusing right through the very end of the end credits. Looks like I finished in just under 5 hours, but what a ride! I think I'll probably purchase Portal 2. Even if it's only half as good as this game, it's twice as expensive so.....I'll probably wait a bit to to see if it goes on sale.   TIP: Don't disable any turrets till you have a chance to listen to all of their dialogues. And don't move onto the next level too soon or you'll interrupt and miss the main computer's amusing lines. Excellent writing!  P.S. Just after posting this review, I accidentally discovered a free mod on Steam for Portal owners that adds 19 additional puzzles! It's called Rexaura. I almost missed out!

(listen to \"Still Alive\" during the credits....lol!).  An amazing game that requires you to think in a new and unique way. Add in the ability to replay the maps with even harder difficulty and challenges adds to the replayablilty. Looking forward to the maps the online community is bound to make!

{"funny_percent":2.2971014492753623,"helpful_percent":0.9922258690436971,"review":"Life was meaningless.  I had no purpose other than to continue my work, the only thing I had ever known. Work had been fun at first, and my boss had seemed nice and rather witty. However after some time, my boss began acting strange. It started with the lying. Then, my boss began to intentionally make my work dangerous. I survived, but only through quick thinking and a bit of luck.  Eventually the everyday grind of navigating my way through a neverending maze lost any appeal. My boss promised me cake when the job was completely done, but it wasn't worth it. I wished for something, anything, even death, that would rid me from this meaningless existence. I was tempted several times to walk infront of a turret or fall into the radioactive slime, but the pain these methods would bring seemed greater than the pain of a meaningless life, so I carried on.  Then one day, my boss had a surprise for me. He had brought me a Companion to assist me in my work. Or more specifically, an Aperature Science Weighted Companion Cube. At first, the Companion Cube assisted me with basic tasks which I nonetheless couldn't have done without it. We rounded a corner and came face to face with a ball of radioactive energy coming straight towards us.  I thought we were doomed, but then the Companion Cube jumped in front of me of its own accord and shielded me from certain death. My mouth dropped, as I imagined the pain the Cube must have been experiencing. My boss said something about \"symptoms of enrichment center testing\" and \"perceiving inanimate objects as alive\" but I paid no attention. I knew this was love. I knew this was real.  We continued on together for a while. The Cube was essential in completeing the task my boss had set for me. I tried talking to it, but I received no response. My boss then oddly informed me that the Companion Cube would never threaten to stab me (as if it would ever)...but more importantly he informed me that my Cube was mute. I felt a pang of sadness - not the selfish sadness one feels when they lose something, but the true sadness that is felt when empathizing with another being.  This revelation did not hamper my love for my Cube, my Companion, who had brought happiness and joy into my life, and who had selflessly endured pain to save me from death. After opening the final door which would lead to the elevator I had grown quite familiar with, our boss seemed to congratulate us on our new found compaionship. But then the bos said something which would change my life forever.  \"However, [the Companion Cube] cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and, unfortunately, must be euthanized. Please escort your Companion Cube to the Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator.\"  I gasped in horror, looking across the room and seeing what I now realized must be the Incinerator. I fell to my knees, tears already streaming down my cheeks. I looked at my faithful Companion and proceeded to envelop it in my arms, determined to never let it go.  My boss continued on as if nothing was wrong. \"While it has been a faithful companion, your Companion Cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test. If it could talk - and the Enrichment Center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot - it would tell you to go on without it because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you.\"  \"You could never be a burden to me!\" I cried, and hugged my Companion Cube to my chest. But then I remembered. Although my boss had lied to be at one time, boss had since promised that he could no longer lie to me. I had to finish the testing, or else I would never get the Cake. And if the Cube couldn't come with me...didn't want to come with me...  I hugged it one last time then picked myself up off the floor. I walked slowly, hesitantly, toward the button that would open the incinerator. It took more willpower than I've ever needed to press it. Then I picked up my Companion and held it over the flames. Tears clouded my vision and my hands began to sweat uncontrollably, and not just from the heat. I held it there for what seemed like hours, just crying and admiring its beauty. But then I remember the Cake. And the Cube slipped from my hands.  \"You euthanized your faithful Companion Cube more quickly than any test subject on record,\" said my boss. \"Congratulations.\"  11/10 would euthanize my Companion at the behest of my boss and all for a piece of cake again.","hours":3.6}

How could you ignore this masterpiece for so long? You probably think your efforts will be rewarded with cake.  The reward is the game itself.

The story is that you play the role of a test subject, Chell, trapped in an abandoned building known as Apature Science. A mysterious voice instructs you to go through several test chambers with the use of a portal gun, a device that can shoot portals in order to teleport one place to another. So it all relies on your skill and brain power in order to escape Apature alive, while enjoying some cake for your victory... maybe. As the name states, the game is all about portals. Wether it be using portals to get to a higher area, or to get a weighted cube to hold down a switch, it's always fun to just mess around with the portal gun. There are 19 Levels and most of the puzzles are pretty easy, so it's a short game. There are also advanced maps and time trials that'll keep ya busy if you think the game is too easy. While it's sequel is much more popular, it's predecessor is still fun to play.","hours":10}

The chambers get progressively harder and all the while GLaDOS becomes more malicious in her comments. For completing all the trials your character is promised cake and grief counseling in the end.
