Had a rough launch but Treyarch seems to be the only activision COD developer who cares about PC gaming; rolling out bug fixes quickly and including FOV slider.  This has true Dedicated server support and support of unranked modded servers. The community has very much diminished, and most of the lower latency NA servers are mostly Nuketown forever game types with almost no servers hosting DLC. Buying DLC for this is only justifiable if you desire to play the Zombies game mode; which is an absolute blast, especially with friends; going for those higher levels and finding all the easter eggs.  My favorite part of this COD is the gunplay. Trades in gunfights tend to go to the more skilled player rather than the player who sees the other first (like we see in newer COD titles).  In summary:  Pros: Twitch Shooter with skill oriented gun play True Dedicated Servers with Mod Support on unranked Servers Zombies gametype with tons of replay  Cons: 90 FPS Cap (Old Quake engine bugs when running over 120 FPS) Lack of Eyefinity or Surround multi Display support (Flawless Widescreen or Widescreen fixer solves this) Small Community Nuketown everywhere No point of buying DLC unless you like the zombies game type","hours":91.1}

During those years I've played all of the Call of Duty games repeatedly over and over again. I don't have exact count, but I can assume each game 4-5 times except Black Ops 1. Why? As far as I can remember, I just didn't want this game to be like others. So for 4 years I didn't play it because I didn't want to, but I can remember that last 2 years I didn't play it because I couldn't. However thank to those 6 years of Black Ops absence in my gaming life, I have recieved even better gaming experience these days than back in 2011 and one of the best gaming experiences during last years.   This is how Call of Duty is supposed to look like, and this is how FPS game is supposed to look like. Storytelling is whole new level for entire Call of Duty universe and you cannot deny that. I love the way how even 2 seconds flashback in like 3rd mission gets explained in the end just by one sentence, without even showing that certain flashback to remind you. You can argue that story is not really that deep. Yes, I know that surely there are way way way more deeper stories than this one, but for mainstream game, for AAA game and for Call of Duty, this one is really deeper than usual. I am talking a lot about it but why not. For me it's more important than gameplay and whole interaction with the world.  I also do know that this review is not objective at all, because my rating will be really high, and also every gamer have something that he loves in particular. Either it is era, persons, countries and of course events. And maybe that is why I admire Black Ops 1 - it has all what I love in particular.   Also I do like that usual and standard feature called \"Mission Select\". I just love it when it is in game. It helps you with achievements, to get them faster, and also you can reply some significant missions without having to play it all over again. I also like the way they put music during the missions. Yeah, I'm talking about Creedence Clearwater Revival.  Locations you'll visit are very-well picked. From wet jungles of Laos and 'Nam to cold Ural Mountains to hot cosmodrome in Baikonur. Notable real characters for me: Fidel Castro & JFK. Notable missions: EVERY. The variations of missions and nature of what you'll do is just absolutely awesome. I love every single objective you have to do and I love every single step you have to do.   People complain about price point, but let me tell you this - cry about every other COD game that goes after BO1.That's it.   I know that my reviews for AAA games are usually not great at all and I do struggle with them, but that's the way it is and I'll try to improve it as much as I can. Things I won't comment either because I don't want to or I'll in future: Graphics, Downloadable Content, Zombies, Multiplayer.  Bonus Point: Alex Mason Rating: 10/10 ","hours":77.9}

I ended up finishing the campaign on ‘Veteran’ difficulty which changed my whole perspective of the game.  It’s now my opinion that ‘Veteran’ difficulty is the best way to experience this campaign. It fits perfectly with the dark and gritty tone of the game’s design. Which caused me to become much more immersed in the action. The music is really cool too which also helped to pull me into the world.  The ‘Zombie’ mode is, of course, also great here and most of these maps have become classics. I didn’t play too much of the Multiplayer but the maps look great. I’m always amazed with the high quality visuals and attention to detail in Call of Duty Multiplayer maps.  This is an innovative and amazingly dark game which is loaded with replay value. The Call of Duty series has become completely mainstream now and receives a lot of criticism from gamers for being generic. Black Ops is just as interesting and immersive as any other great game. It’s a total classic and I highly recommend that you go back and play through the campaign on ‘Veteran’ difficulty.","hours":89.6}

The bad things, slightly framerate drops in multiplayer (dont worry, doesnt happen too much) but if its happen sometimes you want to kill someone at the same time its annoying. Chopper Gunner Killstreak in multiplayer is so overpowered and its worst thing that can happen to you, even with M.O.A.B i can deal with it in MW3 but not with CG in BO1. What i also dont like is, the massive action in singleplayer, they could have been lowered the action so you will not be bombarded with weapon noizes all the time and massive explosions also. Sure its cool and something that belongs to COD games but sometimes its too much.  If the games age (2010) doesnt matter, buy this COD if you are planning to buy your first COD on PC.","hours":41.7}

The 1960's, CIA Black Ops in Russia and the Vietnam War, conspiracies, and a diabolical political plot to topple nations... all taken seriously in a totally immersive and epic experience. The gameplay is varied, indoors and outdoors, from lush tropical jungles to intelligence headquarters buildings, in a number of different historical conflicts. No spoilers, but the whole story is about finding a hidden, classified truth that is as mindblowing as the warheads that threaten to destroy the world. This dynamic and interesting campaign is unmatched, certainly throughout the Call of Duty series, as well as all the games I've played. It may not be the newest game, but the plot is worth it, I guarantee.  Although the plot and story elements alone are enough to warrant a purchase, it is as fun of an ADS FPS as I've ever played, with decent graphics, punchy weapons, and great levels. I've played through the entire game on Veteran Difficulty, the most challenging difficulty, and had an absolute blast. There's not an overwhelming amount of collectables, and they remain found after multiple playthroughs.  The Zombies mode in this game is also great, probably better than Black Ops 2. It's not overly complicated like its sequel, and is just solid and hardy. I'm terrible at Zombies and still loved it. In one level you actually get to play as John F. Kennedy fighting zombies in the US Pentagon. Awesome? Awesome.  One of my favorites! This isn't a review for the multiplayer, but it is also spectacular and they come together when you get black ops.","hours":29.3}
