Geometry Dash is one of the most awesome and frustrating games I have ever played. With currently 20 official levels (soon to be 21 at the time of me writing this), thousands and thousand of user levels, fun gamemodes, and challenges, Geometry Dash will make you scream, smash your keyboard, and engage in bursts of profanity for hours.  The awesome and unforgettable soundtrack for the main levels is another reason why you should check this game out. The many songs you can encounter in the game's official and user levels are all upbeat and fun to listen to. Artists like Waterflame, F-777, Bossfight, DJ-Nate, and TheFatRat are only some of the song creators you will learn about when playing this game.  You can also collect stars, secret coins, and user coins by beating the official levels and user levels, and it will keep track of how many demon levels you beat. (Demon is the hardest difficulty)  Overall, Geometry Dash is the definition of a rage game : frustrating levels, fun gameplay, and hours of unforgettable songs.  Final Verdict : 9/10.","hours":172.4}

I've been a long time fan, playing the game on mobile since 1.5 (Theory of everything) The Steam version is great, because, PC versions are always better, so if you have the mobile version and you're looking to \"Upgrade\" your game, this is your ticket. I highly disagree with people who try to crack the game. Come on, what are 4 dollars just to support the person who made us this amazing game? With that said, I will list all the pros and cons, comparing to the mobile version: Pros: -Obviously better graphics, the backgrounds look beautiful and the blocks are more detailed, you can also adjust graphics to your prefference, varying from quiality, windowed mode resolution, as well as some other adjustments. -The level editor interface is VERY comfortable, there's a shortcut key for EVERYTHING. Nothing compared to Bluestacks. Using the new layers mode, you can classify your objects of the level in groups, for example, you can use one layer for solid blocks, one for decor, one for effects, etc... Incredibly helpful, as this will prevent you from constantly fighting with the game, in order to select an object which is placed in the same location as others. -Gameplay is great. Multiple ways to jump, and keys to place and remove checkpoints on practice. Really looking foward to being able to make your own controls scheme on 2.1! -2 exclusive icons. 'Cause why not, exclusives are always good. -Incredibly faster online performance. On mobile, it' almost impossible to save your progress. On PC it's done quick, songs are downloaded fast, as well as levels. -Tired of your phone/tablet running out of battery but you want to keep playing? No longer a problem! Unless you don't pay your electricity service (Higly unlikely) or have laptop (Just play while plugged in).  Cons:  -Obviously, this great version cannot be taken on the go, so... Back to mobile GD.  Alas, I'm done. This version is amazing. Recommended 100% to every Geometry Dash mobile player and newcomer as well. Thanks for reading, hope this makes you decide to buy the game! 10/10 -IGN","hours":945.2}
{"funny_percent":0.5,"helpful_percent":0.9344181140775711,"review":"I definitely love this game. I would totally recommend it, though I should probably list a few pros and cons.  Pros. - The music is breathtaking. - Contains a level creator for those creative minds out there. - The level design (especially in some user made levels!) is amazing. - The game is dirt cheap. - It's a great challenge to those who want a difficult game. - It serves as a good excuse when your monitor gets destroyed. - Icon/vehicle customization. - There are a whole bunch of achievements, icons, and colors to hunt. - A very simple game to learn the controls of (you pretty much only press one button.) - A Lenny Face icon unlockable. - It's absolutely addicting. - You can get it on mobile as well, and create a GD account so you can sync Steam and Mobile together, getting the ability to save and cross over your progress. Edit; - With the challenge this game brings, comes a massive feeling of triumph after completing a level that makes all the trouble worth it.  Cons. - Despite the simple controls, the game is very hard to master. - Very prone to causing rage. - Can elicit crippling depression if you fail at a high percentage. - Most levels contain flashing lights. This can be disorientating and possibly trigger epilepsy. - The learning curve starts off very smooth, but once you get into a higher skill range, you must devote more time into gaining more skill. Not recommended for people who don't have much patience. - Can possibly make you clench so hard that you need to get out some prunes.  But despite the cons, I feel this game is an absolute must have, and is worth every penny. Which, luckily enough, isn't too many. :)","hours":121.3}

Geometry Dash isn't the kind of game I expected to come across and play, but here I am today with 1,409.5 hours on record at the moment. Keep in mind that I was not on the Steam version of the game the entire time I have played it.   Having played Geometry Dash since late 2014, this game had me hooked from the start. Though It is nice and simple to learn how the game functions, it is nearly impossible to master. There are various user-created levels with different styles, songs, and difficulties in case you do end up finishing all of the main levels. You can unlock new icons if you play enough levels. With the 2.1 update, you will have a long journey to obtain all of these icons and believe me when I say it is time-consuming. I'm not a huge fan of this game's community at it's current state but there is just something about it that I adore so much about it but I just can't put my finger on it. And if you like the community, then you'll know there are some highly skilled players out there who have come and gone over the span of this game's life span who have left marks on the game entirely. Robtop is a very clever developer when it comes to designing the game's new features like the new orbs that he added, which is something that everyone seems to overlook considering that he is \"slow\" when it comes to updating the game. You can't judge this game by looking at it once, you will need to play it for yourself to see if it is for you... which the game is very attractive to it's new players (especially the price of $3.99).   I give the game an 8 / 10  The only issue I have with this game is that the updates are not frequent as they used to be before the 1.9 update, which is what can kill hype for the game. Also, with the editon of the 2.1 update, the update was released without the \"High Detail\" feature in the graphics settings. Back in 2.0, having the option to have high quality made the game look so crisp and I wish this update could've had this feature implemented. Another issue I have is that this game depends on 60fps for it's physics to work properly, which is why players with an 144hz monitor has an advantage over those with 60hz display.

When you ready, then you can go to the immediate death normal mode.   One thing about the spawns though, because they are programmed I think, not placed by an actual person, so, sometimes you keep respawning in this awkward position, where you are in mid-air, you respawn, and it's hard to get ready for the next jump, so you die like 10 times in a row (within like 20 seconds) .

That said, does that mean you should get it? Not necessarily.  Also, my true hours are much higher than what it says on my steam profile, as I was a mobile player for a year and a half.  WHAT IS THIS GAME:  If you've ever seen the impossible game, this game may seem like a clone of that at first. The concept is the same: set, non-random gameplay to the beat of the music, and one fail takes you right back to the beginning. More likely than not, if you buy the game, the first thing you will do is press the big play button in the center of the screen and try out the first few official levels. These levels have the most rudimentary graphics possible, use mostly the cube gamemode (and sometimes the ship) with none of the interesting mechanics.  Advance a few more levels, and you will get to the stuff you see in the steam trailer. Chances are, if that trailer (or the store page in general) are the first you're seeing of the game, then all of that gameplay looks quite confusing and complicated to you - or maybe it doesn't, I can't read your mind. If it does, though, you are in for a shock...  The real gem of this game is the level editor. This is, without any doubt, the most comprehensive and powerful level editor that I have seen in any videogame. Over the years, I've watched custom levels go from simply a part of the game, to far, FAR, F A R outstripping what the dev could ever make himself. This game allows you to use any song on the newgrounds.com audio portal - several hundreds of thousands of mostly electronic music tracks ranging from high to exceptional quality.  Allow me to leave a few examples. Keep in mind that this review was last updated on Sep 27, 2017, and that the quality of levels being built doubles every few months. If you're reading this in 2018, something better is out already.

Free data backup! Comment on levels! Spam friend requests to famous people! Block someone if they're a d-bag! Profile posts! All of this can be yours, just 1 account creation away. -\"Game balance\" and being mad at the dev about it is not an issue in this game, everything pretty much is what it is (Deal with it motherfricker) -No story required! Just cut the crap and play a totally ambiguous game where skill is the only thing that matters. Oh, and your system specs xDDDDDDD -No multiplayer! Make \"server lag\" a moot point! -You can grind up the leaderboard just by playing levels that are easy for you, or even automatic. -Play as much as you want! Grind as much as you want! No BS timers, ever! Virtually no limiting factors of play! Quit whenever you want, too - game doesn't try to tell you when to play it!  CONS:  -VERY hard game, no matter how skilled or experienced you are. Don't expect to not die. Ever. You will die hundreds of times before you complete some levels. If you do stuff that's difficult for you, that number of deaths will be at 4 or 5 digits. Be prepared to spend hours on one single level wanting to kill yourself the whole time, but being unable to escape because this game is basically cocaine. -\"Geometry dash physics\". Seen how janky other games can be? ohhhh boyyyyyyy, every time you come up to a ramp at a high speed (especially on 144hz) you best hope it'll be nice to you. -99.9% male community. Don't get triggered that I put this in cons, it's just that all-male gaming groups tend to have a higher rate of being cancer. -With how much freedom creators have in the level editor, it ends up as a double edged sword. They can make anything (including you) move randomly or be invisible just to name a few examples, so you are putting your life in the level creator's hands when playing a custom level. -Community ranges from pretty great to worse than league of legends. Some famous people that will go unnamed are incredibly toxic manipulators, and drama or hacking allegations are common. Chances are that you'll never deal with any of this directly, but this game has ruined lives. -Updates take forever to come out, and always come out buggy and unfinished. We are dealing with bugs that were spawned 8 MONTHS AGO because the dev has not released a single bug patch that he has been promising for the last 8 months. IMO he procrastinates like crazy or something. I don't know. (EDIT: This patch is now released and it came with a boatload of new features, disregard.) -Wanna be pro? You basically need a 144hz monitor. Of course, that comes with bugs of its own. I don't have one and I've gotten along fine, so this is not really relevant for new players. -If you want to go far with this game, lay low until you are at least decent. While what players like me consider \"noobs\" are the vast majority of the community, they're really oppressed for some reason. It's definitely an \"earn your respect\" game, and you will constantly be annoyed by people that know less than you being idiots about one thing or another. -Don't read level comments, once RobTop implemented sorting by likes in 2.1 it all went to garbage. -As I said, this game is cocaine. If you like amateur electronic music, rhythm games, and crazy challenges, you will begin your drug addiction if you download this game. By making this a \"thumbs up\" review I am telling you to buy drugs. The drugs are only $4 for an unlimited supply. Sounds like a good deal to me. So... whaddaya say, pal?","hours":823.3}

It can be tricky to learn to jump with the mouse if you are a mobile veteran but you learn fast. It has better graphics and it doesn't lag, downloading songs is faster and has 2 new exclusive icons.   EDIT: With the 2.0 update the game is now perfect you can make incredible levels and there are ton of new icons, a new gamemode, new stages, user profile system, etc.  10/10","hours":168.5}
