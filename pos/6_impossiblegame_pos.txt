I will now proceed to give a review of the UK's own Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital.  Firstly, all the staff there take good care of those of us who have been admitted. We get to do regular daily activities, we have 3 meals a day (All cooked on site, full courses) and we do get to spend time with other patients should we be having a good day. My room itself is fairly plain; 4 walls, 1 window, a bed, a sink with 2 taps; and recently I've even been allowed a few photos on my wall and a carpet!  A normal day consists of going to the mess hall for breakfast at 8am sharp. Well that's the case for my group, anyway, as not everyone is allowed to eat at the exact same time. The doctors say it's because it could be unsafe having that many patients in a room together. After breakfast we have classes for certain activities. My favourite is art because it allows me to express both my personalities, and expel my rage without causing damage to another human. I like to draw pictures with orange squares, black squares and blue triangles, because I see them in my dreams. My group has lunch at 1.30pm. After we have lunch we are taken to the medical wing where we undergo evaluation physically and mentally to assess our progress. Sometimes, depending on how we've done, we have to go for more rigorous tests, otherwise we just move onto the next part of our day. After our evaluations we're allowed to go out into the yard in small groups to have some fresh air. We can play sports with the assigned trainer for that day, or just relax in the sun. When we've finished in the yard it's time for dinner, at 6pm. We tend to have dinner in bigger groups because there are more staff to help out at that time. Anyway, after dinner we do group reading, in which we have to talk about the books. My group leader says it's to help with communication with others. It's nice, I really like it. Finally, at 8 o'clock pm, we're allowed to pick a book and take it back to our room so we can read if we wish to at night. It helps a lot of the patients keep calm when the lights go out.  Treatment here is really nice, although sometimes if we start to show increasing signs of instability or anger, the doctors and nurses can and will use a straight jacket or sedation depending on the situation at hand. I haven't had this happen to me a lot, only when I have the bad dreams of the orange and black squares and the blue triangles.  Occasionally my family come to visit, to see how I am. I like seeing my family, although I miss my brother. My last memory of him was sitting at my computer playing a video game, I think it had the word 'Impossible' in the title, but I can't really remember. It's all blurry. My family normally come once a month and sometimes they just seem upset to see me, but my personal nurse assures me that it's just me worrying too much.  I really like it here, although I can't remember much from the real world anymore. My nurse says that I will have to stay here for possibly another decade, but I'm okay with that because everything in here seems normal to me now. All I can really remember from my old life is playing video games, but ever since I got admitted I suddenly didn't miss playing them. I'm not sure if there's a connection there. I don't think so.  Overall that is my life in a nut-shell now. It's not a glamorous life, but it's quaint and quiet and it's my life, what it is and what it is going to be for the next decade or so.","hours":4.5}

This game is the evil brother of Thomas.  This game is just ... impossible to win without hours of practice and tuning your mind into a state that allows utmost concentration and remembering all the jumps and holes.   The graphics are simple, the music is best and the gameplay is more than challenging. You are a square that moves from left to right and you have to avoid colliding with the obstacles. You jump over triangles and jump on or over other squares. For 1-2 minutes and then the game is over. If you get so far that is. I don't have the patience and time to finish this, so I took the easy route by placing checkpoint flags that let you start from your specific point in the run. Even then it takes some time to finish a level.  All in all it is a nice game to have fun with for a while, until you had enough and go for some easy achievements. Or go for gold.

You are a square and you try to avoid any obstacle in your way, if you touch anything you are not supposed to, you die and get back to the start of the level.  The game itself ist that hard as the name states, you have a set pattern of objects, since you cant stop, you are probably die the first couple of times you go trough them, but after you memorize them, its pretty straight forward.  It does have however, artificial difficulty, very noticeable when switching from auto jumps to manual jumps. The game adds some obstacles where you only have half of a square to land and some (a lot of) times it does a slide to your death instead of jumping. i can differenciate when i ♥♥♥♥ up and when the controls didnt responded.

The PC port is damn near excellent, giving me a smooth 60fps, and the controls feel very tight so I know it was my fault when I messed up. Also amazing is how well designed the four levels are, every jump feels like it requires precise timing and the music syncs up to them fairly well. And even if somehow you manage to complete all of the levels, there's still the infinite amount of custom levels created by the community ready to be downloaded. The level editor is a little tricky to work with, and syncing music to your track is easier said than done. Plus, the only way to test your level with the music playing in the background is from the very begining. Because of this, if you have one specific part you want to test to see how well it plays with the music, you have to play through the entire god-damn level to figure it out. I would suggest a \"Test from this point\" button of some sort added in. Other than this though devs, you have yourself a great port!

{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.650442454629984,"review":"This game should be renamed to Stockholm Syndrome. It constantly treats you like crap and laughs in your face as you fail over and over again. But for some reason, something deep inside you makes you keep playing this simple, bare-bones platformer over and over again.  Here's a video of the game if you want to see just how impossible this is. If you would rather read, then just continue below.   YouTube™ Video: The Impossible Game Quick Look  Views: 37,480 Watch Noble of Lost Pause take a Quick Look and fail pretty hard at the Impossible game. This time, the game is actually true to its name....   So what is this game about? You play as a hot-blooded cube determined to propel itself forever to the right, and it will stop at nothing until it reaches the end. Spikes, walls, and pratfalls are you're only enemies. But they are a mighty force to be reckoned with. Timing is the key factor to avoid instant death, and the only thing your hard-boiled cube can do is jump. But damn is that jumping satisfying. Everything relies on your split-second reflexes, and when you do make it, it feels good. Real good.  But let's talk about more of the game's features. On the top of the screen is a counter that will surely go up for ever time you die. But don't fret, your cube is swiftly reborn, better, stronger, and wiser than the last. Well, just as long as you don't make stupid mistakes. And everytime you retry, you will slowly inch your way closer to the end goal of beating the impossible game.  There is a total of 5 levels you can play, each one with challenging mechanics like flipping the screen or falling blocks. There is also a level editor you can use to make more impossible levels if you ever do the unthinkable and beat the game. But for simple cubes like myself, there is a system of putting down flags that restart you from where you set them down, which allows steady progression towards the end instead of having to begin all over again. Sure it might be called \"practice\" or \"weenie\" mode, but it's still difficult enough just reaching the end one jump at a time.  If I had to list some negatives, the one thing I could say is that you can get this game for cheaper on your phone or ipad, since it originated from there. The basic controls make it quite apparent. However, $4 on steam and $3 on the humble bundle is not asking for a lot. Even $5 when it goes off sale. So if price is an issue, just wait for this to go on discount in the near future like always.  So to sum everything up, I say this game is well worth the money spent. It's mindless fun, and you can even have a beer or eat a hot pocket while you play this game. And what a beautiful thing that is.","hours":2.1}
