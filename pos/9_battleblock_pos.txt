The gameplay is exhilarating as you run through these obstacle courses set up by devious cats. The thing that makes this game the most fun is playing on hard mode where the most will come out of you as a player and even though it can be annoying or tough, it's what makes the BattleBlock Theater experience better. Also, I would like to add, even though I have little time played on steam, I have owned this game on the Xbox 360 for years, and I could still come back to it and play it again.","hours":2.3}

That's usually when you want shut your brain off and play something amusing and stupid. If you can find a buddy in a similar state, play this game together.   The trick to enjoying this game is to not take it seriously. Learn to enjoy killing and being killed. If you can pull that off, you will laugh until you cry. Play for about an hour or so and then quit. Come back another day when you both are out of it again. Then just repeat this cycle.  If you don't enjoy poop jokes, stay away.

That was until, my friend named DT, Said he had found the perfect game for me.  \"It's called BattleBlock Theater\" he said as if he was the creator And I replied, \"Eh, I'll look at it later.\" Soon later came, and I said with a sigh, \"Let's get this over with so I can finish my pie.\"  After watching the two trailers, my mind was blown! Buying this game, I shall not postpone. I clicked the \"Buy Game\" button on the internet, and I zoomed through the PayPal process which is actually quite intricate.  I waited for nothing and immediately installed, An adventure that assured I would soon be enthralled. Soon enough it was done, and I double-clicked on its name, Waiting impatiently for my brand new game.  And just like that I was playing away! Staring deeply into my monitor's display. I was jumping, punching, and boating through any kind of weather, And best of all, me and DT were doing it together.  So, I urge you to get out your money, And pay for this game whose humor is funny. I promise you, if you buy this you will not be disappoint As this game is amazing to no defined point.","hours":42}

This is a 4 Player online platformer that has a great mechanism in controls and really addictive and easy to pick up on. The game has 2 Player Co-op Adventure mode, Or 4 In Arena mode. Adventure mode can either be normal or INSANE ( insane mode, is one death mode basically) The game can be pretty brutal in some stages with insane mode.  Arena mode Targets 2v2 team and has a lot of great endless fun modes Capture the Fla... Horse .. its called capture the horse which is same as CTF but a horse that looks like a piece of walking candy, and even more fun Or Basketball which is my personal favorite and its something you wont play just once : ) And a lot more Modes from soul catcher ( Kill and get their souls) To \"Grab the gold\" 9 Different fun modes.  The mechanism of the game makes it possible to do a great teamwork in adventure mode. You can pick up your friend and throw him or he just simply jumps on your head to reach a high place and then lifts you up to join him, or use a weapon to blast your friend to a certain places, and just be creative with what you wanna do :).  A huge selection of weapons and faces, ( You can make your own face and put it in game folder for everyone to see) the game is basically Get the (Certain number) of Gems in each level and reach the end in the best time ( And the hidden yarn ball )  Gems buys you Faces, Yarn balls buys Weapons.  WITH! the ability to Trade them in-game or in steam trading system, or even sell them on steam market. Which is a good feature because you cant buy a certain thing you just buy and the outcome is random.  Each weapon is different and has a different use and great ways to make combos with. You can either play good to finish, play dirty team killing, or see who can reach the end first. Some levels however relies on teamwork cant afford to be selfish there.  With this ADORABLE looking graphics and soundtracks fun can never end, They made it even more fun by making Level Editor to make your own levels/playlists of levels, arenas or whatever the hell you want to make. Steam workshop was definitely a great feature for the steam version.  THIS Game has the FUNNIEST STORY I have ever seen in a video game, Every Cut scene you will be a FOOL to skip it because its just ... too .. funny and perfect with that amazing narrator.  its sad that they asked that no one posts a review or livestream or a video while on beta, but everyone did anyway .... and so i tried to make this review as resourceful as possible, so people would actually get a clue of what this game is if they never heard of it before or was wondering about it.  This game is worth every penny, watch some youtube commentary videos on its gameplay and decide for yourself :)    A Few updates.  they keep adding some special faces you can get by finishing every once and a while so its cool  and for summer sales people are wondering if the game is worth playing just for singleplayer  yes , i have maybe 20 hours stored only singleplayer playing this wonderful game alone is also fun and the levels changes when you play singleplayer to be set to solo mode ( Makes it possible to do everything solo ) and in multiplayer they are set for double so you need someone else to help you finish the level or you can also use the weapons to do it alone if you're good enough with them.  So yeah its pretty much fun singleplayer grinding for faces and achievements is always fun : ) hopefully you'll make the right choice and buy this and make sure you have friends to play with  its more fun that way","hours":56.6}
{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.8525942445749655,"review":"The Behemoth’s 2D platformer BattleBlock Theater is full of quirky humor (like in Castle Crashers which is also a Behemoth game).  This game is not only for platformer-lovers. It's for all who like great entertainment, for gamers who love to play alone, for those who love to play coop, for the creative people and level builders, for the achievement hunters, the item collectors and people who want to own others!  Humor: I really enjoyed the opening monologue and all the other little movies between some levels. You will also hear funny comments when you are playing. How to describe the jokes? I would say it’s a mix out of poop jokes with pop-culture references. About some jokes you will laugh and about other jokes you will raise your eyebrow. In harder levels when you are frustrated because you die so often the speaker also makes some taunting statements which motivate you or make you wanna find him and kill him. :o 10/10  Sound: Narrator: The narrator talks clearly and with a great accent. I’ve understood everything and my english isn’t the best. So he did his job very well! ^^ Music: The songs are always convenient and make a funny, peaceful atmosphere.  Settings: You can change the volume PLUS how much you want to hear from the talker. 10/10  Graphic: The game has an amazing quality of animation. Even too the characters have a simple design it’s still cute and clearly what they represent. It animates you to collect more characters in a curious, partial addicted way. And there are so many character styles to collect that everyone will fall in love with one! If you don’t get your favorite with your green diamonds you can also swap with other players. 10/10  Gameplay: You have so many possibilities and different game modes that you don’t know with what you should start. lol Seriously if you really want to do everything in the game with a perfect result you can spend aplenty of your time there. For example there is a storymode (playable on normal and insane difficulty) for singleplayer and a bit different one for coop where you have to throw your partner to some places or to pull him up. Sometimes you just have to jump on his head to reach a gem and sometimes you have to shoot him somewhere… which is really funny especially when your mate dies cause of an accident (stupidly). xD   You can play features and levels made by other players. PLUS you also can create OWN LEVELS… There are no limits!  Besides you can play with 2-4 players in the arena (choose a fast game or a special game mode). Some modes you can play versus other players: Capture the Horse (it’s like capture the flag in other games e. g. “Booster Trooper”), basketball, teamdeathmatch, soulcatcher and so on!  In all game modes you can get ‘Gems’ and ‘Yarn balls’. With Gems you can buy faces, with yarn balls weapons. The weapons all make different stuff (e. g. freezing someone into an ice-cube) and different damage or they just blow the enemy away. There are also different ways to make combos with. So you can evolve your own tactic.  For so many possibilities and no lags in multiplayer I give: 10/10  Tradesystem: You can see all your items (faces, weapons, gems, yarn balls…) in your INVENTORY in Steam. So you can make your trade in-game or with the steam trading system. Means even when you are out of the game you can send someone a trade offer about which items you want to swap. You can also sell some of the items (those which are marketable) or buy some of them. So also those who have no luck with the drops in the game can reach on every way what they want. That’s just awesome! 10/10  Conclusion: I am totally in love with this game and I highly recommend it! ♥","hours":6}

Without campaign multiplayer and singleplayer theres also another gamemodes like minigames which are even more fun when you're bored or completed the game. There are still players out there and matches can be found. Its not dead at all and at a low price of 2,99 Euro many can afford this masterpiece.

I honestly wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was, despite being a good fan of Castle Crashers. The videos of it didn't look too terribly interesting, but lemme tell ya. This is definitely a game worth picking up. This game actually has much smoother framerate than the previous The Behemoth release on steam, Castle Crashers. It runs without a hitch, and without a framerate cap.  I thought the voice acting of one of my personal vocal heroes was top-notch. (Definitely left a \"stamp\"... Dohohohoho...) The jokes were often corny, but it was tightly written in kind of a \"I know this writing is bad, so I might as well go all out\" kind of way. Makes it feel very light-hearted which is much appreciated in this barrage of \"oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ another gray Call of Gooby.\"  The controls feel very tight, although I do actually find the combat to be rather clunky. However the combat isn't as important as the platforming aspects, which are top notch. The variation of weapons are also a plus. Speaking of variation, I have a lot of work ahead of me if I want to unlock all of those heads hahaha.  The music fit the game nicely, and while it doesn't stand out, it is the perfect ambiance I need to push through and play in a \"zenned out\" state.  I recommend this game to everyone who is into platformers. It's such a great game and you should not pass it up.","hours":19.4}

Bugs There are no current bugs that I know of or have had any problems with.  BattleBlock Theater also has full controller compatibility, or you could use your keyboard.

Pros ✓ Subtle yet captivating storyline ✓ Ingenious voice acting ✓ Enough unlockables that give you creative new ways to kill or leave your buddy behind complete challenges ✓ So many skins to keep the game fresh and exciting ✓ Rewarding puzzles, with various solutions  ✓ Room for competitive, cooperative and trolly playstyles... all within the same minute ;) ✓ Great soundtrack that ranges from catchy, creative, groovy to funny ✓ Game holds well even with ~300ms ping  Cons ✗ Not really a con but, it might be a relatively less enjoyable single player experience  Other thoughts Without a doubt the most hilarious coop I've ever played. After the first two sessions, I started to take my shirt off pregame so it wasn't soaking in the end from laughing so much. There is online play with strangers but I would highly suggest finding a friend, or even acquantaince, and finishing it with just them first. It's absolutely critical if you're playing coop to have hands free voice comms (eg. discord), because that's where half of the fun lies. Don't hold back the trash talk ;)","hours":33.5}

The story is told by Stamper, if anyone knows him, a guy with a great narrator voice as shown in the game. During the game he will pretty much tell you what is going on and what you shouldn't do: Dieing mostly. In cutscenes he will progress the story and tell you all kinds of things in a fun fashion.  The gameplay is nothing that spectaculair but still really good. It's a puzzle platformer as much as it can be a platformer. In 2D, you will run, jump, ride and slide across blocks of various elements, collecting gems to open the exit. The difficulty progression is steady and with the amount of levels, the final ones will/can be really frustrating but certainly do-able.  The music is happy and upbeat as the game itself and with the great visual style, jokes and voice-acting, I believe this is certainly a game looking into.

And I can happily say this game is heaps of fun! However, it is also heaps of rage. You will try to beat those levels over and over and over again. Some because they are timed, others for the best level grade. My advice is to get a gamepad for that because, while keyboard gameplay is okay, it hurts your fingers a lot more. There are 8 areas and each has 9 standard levels, 2 timed boss levels and 3 timed encore levels. You can even find some secrets levels. You can unlock some new weapons (for yarn) and character faces (for gems) along the way to finish each area. The story is funny and will entertain you with narration and videos. Playing alone is nice but where the game really shines is co-op play. The levels are somewhat changed in co-op to emphasize on teamwork of both players. The game is NOT easy, it will make you angry/frustrated a lot, escpecially in co-op play. I played this mostly with my sister and our stress levels were through the roof. After you are done with the base game there are TONS of user-created levels to play. They are of various quality but most are fun. I did not like arena matches that much but it is up to your preference.

{"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.9593811910919374,"review":"BattleBlock Theater is an updated port of the XBLA version released on Xbox 360 in early 2013. The \"Steam version\" (as it likes to call itself) adds a wealth of Steamworks features, possibly the most of any game released so far, as well as a few gameplay and visual tweaks. These Steamworks features include Workshop for creating, sharing and downloading user-created levels, Inventory support for item trading, online multiplayer and SteamOS support just to name a few.  The game comes from The Behemoth, who you may remember as being credited with Alien Hominid (as far as I am aware, the first example of a Newgrounds Flash game making a leap to a commercial gaming console) and more recently with Castle Crashers. Two well-received games under their belt and you’ll be happy to know that you can count BattleBlock Theater as their third.  You control a miniature Pillsbury Doughboy lookalike, who along with his friends have crashed their “Friend-Ship” onto a mysterious island. Taken prisoner by a legion of insane cats inside a derelict theatre, you are made to run the various obstacle courses (formed of various blocks) and collect gems as you go, purely for their amusement.  During the story mode, your goal is to run through 2D platforming stages, collecting any gems and balls of yarn you see as you go. Not only do these collectables contribute to your overall ranking and score for a stage, you can also spend them in the theatre gift shop. Spending gems will free your captive friends (and allow you to play as them) and the yarn, which is usually the trickiest item to find, can be spent on new weapons. Fitting with the crazy theme the game has going for it, weapons range from guns that fire top-hats, to marching frog dancers that explode. Both weapons and unlocked characters can be traded either in-game or through Steam’s own trading system.  Your character comes equipped with the standard platforming skills. They can perform double-jumps, duck and slide to avoid unpleasant things happening to their head and a basic set of melee attacks for the odd occasion where a villainous feline blocks your path.  As you progress, the stages become increasingly difficult and complex. The blocks you run and jump over may help you get from start to finish, but not all of them are helpful. Block with spikes, blocks of water (you can’t swim!) and even blocks that fire lazer beams will become more and more numerous as you advance through the 8 chapters the game offers, with 13 stages in each. The puzzles also increase in their level of dastardliness, requiring some extra precise jumps, timings for triggering certain switches that can open new paths or create bridges and some time-trial stages where time is certainly not on your side.  The story is narrated by the absolutely wonderful voice of Will Stamper who manages to synergise his unique energy with the quirky and slightly demented theme the game has on display perfectly. Add to this that the majority of the spoken dialogue is exceptionally funny, it works wonders to break up the monotony of what would otherwise be a rather mundane platformer.  The graphics are vivid and colourful, the animations fluid and adorable, capturing The Behemoth’s trademark style that is in itself a thumbs-up to the Flash games of yesteryear. Despite the trailer claiming near infinite FPS and resolution support (made in satire of the “PC master race” mostly), the game is locked to 60FPS and does not scale to non-standard resolutions such as ultra-widescreen displays… I am also guessing you shouldn’t take the “Oculus Rift support” seriously either. The audio mixes bouncy sound effects with a great soundtrack, with Will Stamper lending his vocals to a couple of the song “lyrics” for added hilarity. These are usually limited to the ends of chapters and bonus stages, so as not to overdo it.  The campaign alone is rather lengthy, but being able to replay stages to get a better ranking, find missing treasures and unlock more goodies really adds to the replayability. To top it all off, there are plenty of great user-created levels to download and a comprehensive level editing suite included, as well as a special event list of downloadable levels released every Friday with a unique unlockable friend as a reward. There are also a heap of multiplayer modes, both competitive and co-op for up to 4 players. These range from classic “king of the hill” and “capture the flag” modes, to races and even basketball. Some fiddling with your firewall may be required to get the multiplayer working, though.  BattleBlock Theater delivers a fantastic package of content that is both highly polished, well-paced and with enough variety to keep you coming back even when the main game is done and dusted. With its delightful audio/visual aesthetic and solid controls on both gamepad and keyboard, this is a platformer that anyone can enjoy.  Pros: ~Great presentation and consistently funny ~Amazing value for the price ~Well-balanced difficulty, suitable for all skill levels ~Incredible number of Steam features supported ~Developers still actively supporting the game  Cons: ~Multiplayer connectivity can be fiddly on certain routers and firewalls ~Can’t rebind controller buttons (can rebind keyboard keys, though)","hours":18.8}

Now when i say this i mean in a good way,even though castle crasher's is really good this is better and the sense of humour this game has is second to none. Let's get down to the brass tacs of the game,the graphic's really do this game justice and at time's its like having a leading role in a cartoon show with the cut scene's being nothing short of briliant and they had me in stitches,rolling round on the floor in absolute agony (the last cut scene in game is the best and the song that goes with it is pure comedy gold-reminded me of something i would hear \"MONTY PYTHON\" sing).  SPOILER ALERT**IF YOU HAVENT GOT TO THE END YET AND DONT WANT TO SPOIL IT DONT WATCH THE FOLLOWING VIDEO**SPOILER ALERT  BattleBlock Theater - Ending with Final Song! - YouTube    YouTube™ Video: BattleBlock Theater - Ending with Final Song!  Views: 830,350 This week marks the 10th anniversary of The Behemoth, so they're in turn reoffering the mascot chicken head prisoner. If you haven't already got him, simply load up BBT to score that awesome...   The gameplay itself consists of taking on various level's (as you open up new part's of the prison---\"SORRY THEATER\") and whilst doing so trying to collect all the green gem's and also the ball's of wool (this game does have cat's in so naturally ball's of wool-trust me it goes along with how nutty this game is),now you dont need to collect all of them in the level to get past it,no you just need to find three of them and then the lock opens and the exit is clear.But that is part of the fun of playing the game as you try to find all the gem's and ball's of wool to get that A++ rating for that level. As you progress through the game the challenge's on the level's get tougher and you end up having to pull of jump's and move's that have to be spot on for you to progress,now this doesnt matter on the normal level's but on the timed ones can cause you some absolute \"SCREAM OUT\" moments of pure frustration (honestly i didnt get like that-OH YES YOU DID-NO I DIDNT-YES YOU DID-OK I DID ALRIGHT),but this all add's to the charm of the game as you have that \"one last go\" moment which can last you for hours (trust me i KNOW). The sound in game is one of the highlight's also,and the narrator is one of the funniest thing's i have ever heard in a game in a long time (dare i say i will remember him as much as the narrator from BASTION) and the thing's he say's (his constant \"OH DEAR\" and other comment's as you die are hillarious) and the song's he sing's will stay with you for quite some time.  BattleBlock Theater Development: Narration by Will Stamper ...   YouTube™ Video: BattleBlock Theater Development: Narration by Will Stamper  Views: 503,398 http://www.battleblocktheater.com | Here is behind-the-scenes footage, shot in 2012 during the development of BattleBlock Theater, showing the recording sessions in the Whisper Room.   Now the gem's you earn and the ball's of wool you find are used in game as currency for the thing's you will eventually find yourself buying.Gem's purchase head's and some of these are great and have had a lot of thought and some seem to be just after thought's,but trust me that \"POKEMON\" bug will grab you and you will find yourself wanting to \"GOTTA GET THEM ALL\" (see just like pokemon),the ball's of wool you trade to the cats (WELL THAT FIT'S DUH) for more weapon's and these all seem to play out slightly differently from the boomerang to the grenade they all work slightly differently than the last one did. Having finished the solo version of the game (and the later level's get really challenging-especially the timed one's),i moved on to the multiplayer side of the game. Now this seems to play out just like the solo game and that's what i thought until i realised that without the other person to back me up i would get no where (in some game's like this it doesnt really matter about working together but here it does).

This isn't the full game, its only a beta.   You see in co-op the challenge's are actually aimed at there being more than one player and try to play it solo and you will die and fail straight away.I will be playing it more in co-op now i have finished the solo game and find that this actually does add longevity to what is allready (in this reviewers opinion) a top notch and well developed piece of entertainment. Will you want to play this game,well answer the 2 following question's and you'll know. 1 - Do you like game's to have a wicked sense of humour and consist of laugh out moment's ?? 2 - Are you prepared to loose hour's of your life as the bug grabs you and you must A++ that level no matter what ??? If you answer yes to both then buy this fantastic game straight away and if not buy it anyway and trust me you will never and i mean \"NEVER\" regret it.

It's a platformer with creative level design, and perfect responsiveness (a trait that is ESSENTIAL in the platformer genre).

Whether it was OneMoreLevel.com, Addicting Games, or Newgrounds, Battleblock Theater serves as the manifestation of the classic platformer you'd find on those sites. Collect x and get to the exit.  The plot is simple: You and a group of friends get stranded on an island, kidnapped, and are forced to go through a series of platform-based levels to amuse the island's feline inhabitants, all the while trying to rescue others from your boat who were captured.  With quick wit and style does Battleblock Theater serve to both amuse and delight the player, the game blends black comedy through the outspoken narrator with excellent and generally basic gameplay into a single entity that can provide hours of entertainment.  Levels play out in unique ways to the classic platformer, yet pay homage to those of the genre that have come before it. Unlike most platformers, in a typical level, you can die as many times as you want, and the goal is simply to get three gems in a level to exit. However, due to the construct of the game, you'll likely, based on constructed OCD, end up collecting all possible and the yarn too. Gems can be spent on unlocking new characters which can be in turn used in future levels, while yarn unlocks weaponry.  New concepts, such as specific baddies, blocks, and other functions of the game, are slowly introduced to the player in individual levels to provide for your ability to cope with them in the future. The game makes sure of your understanding of them by forcing them into the completion of levels so you're ready for them in the future.  Battleblock Theater is one of the most addictive games on Steam, and arguably the best platformer the service has to offer. In case it needs to be said, I strongly recommend you add it to your library as soon as possible.","hours":37.6}
{"funny_percent":0.14285714285714285,"helpful_percent":0.6630028024851288,"review":"Product received for free  It's about time I reviewed this one.  BattleBlock Theater is one of the best platformers I've played in recent memory, and considering my background with Nintendo games, that's saying something. The Behemoth's (known for their previous game Castle Crashers) trademark style really comes through here, with it's quirky humor, simple yet aggrivating level design, and a . It's an experience you won't soon forget.  The story follows you, a friend of Hatty Hattington (the best friend of all) after you, Hatty, and all of your other friends are shipwrecked on a mysterious island. You attempt to take shelter in a suposedly abandoned theater, only to see Hatty kidnapped by a bunch of giant cats, forced to wear an old top hat. You (and the rest of your friends, who serve as extra character skins that you can later unlock) are then taken in as prisoner, forced to \"act\" in deadly performances, while Hatty runs the whole thing. The object of the game is to complete eight chapters (seven of which are supposedly shows, while the last one is a vault that leads to Hatty's office) and rescue your friend.  So at face value, the story follows the typical damsel in distress needing to be rescued (though it's not nearly as blatant here as it was in Castle Crashers), though there's much, much more to it than that. The cutscenes that take place after each chapter in the game are all voiced by Will Stamper and Will Stamper alone, with an adorable \"puppet show\" motif in the visuals. These cutscenes all deliver what you would expect from Stamper: a hilarious yet mildly immature animation that knows how to use it's voice actor to his fullest.  There is also the famous \"Secret Song,\" which Stamper does entirely in scat, and the results are nothing short of amazing.  As far as the actual gameplay goes, it's a platformer with all the standard tropes. You got your powerups, enemies, environmental hazards, currency, weapons, checkpoints, and secret areas. The only truly unique thing that BattleBlock Theater offers in it's standard gamplay is the fact that you need at least three gems (the ingame currency) in order to pass each level. This is very easy to do very on, but towards the middle-end of the game this can become difficult to do. However, that doesn't make the gameplay bland, though. The game is very well paced and has only one very mild difficulty spike (not counting the final chapter, which is supposed to be insane and test your limits) that will only trip you up for a while, but you'll adjust pretty quickly.  The game also has an \"arena mode\" which allows you to play one of twelve different competitve games against either the computer, friends locally, or anyone online (if you are lucky enough to have someone join you in the mode you want to play). All of these are extremely fun with the right people and are best played locally, but they can become very boring against the CPU or someone you don't know online.  All and all, this game is a gem and HIGHLY recommended for those of you who want a platformer that isn't excessively hard or mind numbingly easy. It's the perfect balance of both with a lovable narrator and commedy straight out of early YouTube and Newgrounds to boot.  9/10","hours":43.2}

There's always one game that comes along super cheap and it sucks me in and I play it more than any other game I bought during the sale.   We're only on day 4 of the Summer Sale for 2014 and I'm confident in saying that Battleblock Theater is that game! It's great!   If you've played Castle Crashers, you're already familiar with the art style and humore. They're a blast, natch. For Battleblock, they've done away with the click fest hack and slash style and given us a platformer fest that's full of mayhem and puzzles! The controls are super responsive, the game is challenging without being punishing and provides a ton of laughs with the narration and other sight gags packed in.   This game's great! If you're debating it at $3.75 in the summer sale, or any other sale for that matter? Go for it! Hell, I'd be happy even if I'd paid $15 for it.
