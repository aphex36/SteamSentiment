The choices you make will generally only effect how people view you not the main story or information you get. That's why I'm giving this a thumbs down even though it is a great game(because of the story and interaction). I think there are three instances where there are real consiquences for you ractions i.e. real change.   the game also draws out a bit long. I would buy the game again since i got it on sale and i'd recommend getting the game just for the story if it's on sale of course.  first play through i got a \"this choice is blank\" error for an entire chapter at the end of the game. I figured the game just wasn't finished given it's on steam. but nope it was finished in 2014. second play through I got the same error half way through.

Then I found out more in the following episode, and the ending actually didn't do anything all that bold, really. I was back at square one, with characters that I didn't particularly like, in a setting that felt underused since hiding amongst humans is supposed to be the whole points and humans are only important in the entire season for I'd say less than 5 minutes. I like noir, and I think this game may have been going for it, but I just didn't feel like it hit the right notes.  By the end of the season, I can't really think of anything that I liked about this game, which is sad because I liked The Walking Dead Season 1 and 2, and Tales from the Borderlands. After finishing The Wolf Among Us, I haven't touched any other Telltale games. I think deep down, I'm concerned that their other games they're making now might be as disappointing to me as this one.

This felt like more of a movie than a game, for reasons I will explain later, so I'm going to be reviewing the story for the most part, leaving the terrible gameplay mechanics alone.   1.Every plot twist is a fake out of some kind, they are just used to get players to come back for the next episode, writers should not be able to get away with this crap.   2. Every character is 1 dimensional and predictable, and not even likeable, except maybe the protagonist Bigby Wolf, who I'll talk about in my next point. They are also incredibly inconsistent, people will like you at one point and then hate you a minute later for no reason at all other than to create tension and drive the plot. There are also a few characters who serve no purpose whatsoever other than to waste the players time, not sure what Telltale was thinking here.   3. I didn't mind the character of Bigby Wolf, a sheriff who's trying to fight his bloodthirsty nature and become a good person, but I never actually got to see his struggle, because every time Bigby has to make a choice, I get to choose for him, so it's not Bigby trying to overcome his dark side, it's me making the easy choice for him, when I really have no idea what it would actually be like to be in the Wolf's shoes. This isn't how characters should work, the Wolf isn't even a character at all, more of just a vessel for the player to \"direct\" the story with, and so a potentially great character is absolutely wasted.   4. My main issue with these games is that you make the best decision you possibly can in a given scenario, thinking you will be able to explain your decision reasonably later on, but the game never lets you. For example, I mercy killed a character at one point in the game to end his suffering, but later on in the game when people ask what happened to him, I didn't have the option to say \"I mercy killed him,\" I could only say \"I killed him,\" which made everyone mad at me. There is no way I could have foreseen such a stupid restriction on dialogue, and I could have easily avoided making everyone mad if I just had some common sense options for what to say.   5. Here it is, the classic complaint about Telltale games, your decisions legitimately don't matter at all. It felt way more noticeable in this game however. Players might as well choose a random choice at every turn, because the ending will be the same no matter what you do, and characters are scripted to get mad at you or be pleased with you regardless of how you treat them.  There's a million other things I want to whine about here, but I'm trying to keep this review spoiler free, so there you have it.","hours":13.6}

For example, in Life is Strange you arrive at the 2 same ending options no matter what you do before and  but meanwhile your journey toward that final choice felt different depending on the decisions you made.  Here, choices have ABSOLUTELY no consequences whatsoever. On the very short term, the dialogue unfold the exact same way no matter what (sometimes a character will answer you in an unnatural way that would have been a perfectly coherent reaction... to something you DIDN'T choose to say, too bad for you!) and it gets worse on the mid to long term: whatever you do to others, even if your destroyed their lives, in the final act they will still help you if you want them to, in the same logic, even if you helped and protected someone, they will still accuse you if they were designed to do so. The only little consequences to my choices that I can recall were purely cosmetic: for example, ..... actually, now that I think about it, this example, as inconsequential as it is, is the only case I can remember where my decision had ANY impact on the game! And I am talking about a 30sec addition to one of the final cutscenes here, regarding a very incidental side plot, so \"impact\" is kind of an overstatement.  That aside, I didn't like the character of Snow in the second half of the story: she changed for the worst and was quite annoying to me, but that is a very personal judgement and some might still like her a lot!  Finally, the ending make you feel that you played for absolutely nothing: it brings you back to where you started, the situation at the end mirroring exactly the one of the beginning, on purpose (). That could be an interesting premise for a second season, but there is currently none. And anyway, a game should make you feel happy you played it, in itself, even without its sequel(s), here I just feel frustrated :/","hours":24.4}

At least other choice-based games like Mass Effect have quests you can change the outcome of. And there's good/evil meters that allow you to have massively different conversations with people. This game has none of that. The illusion of choice is quickly dispelled when you realize everyone had the same story even if maybe the dialogue was slightly different. Even the choice of how you want the game to end with the villain is hardly consequential at all. You're basically just adding your own twists to the game instead of making important decisions like you may think.    There's absolutely no gameplay in this either.

Of course, times have changed and so have the games.   The game looks wonderful with its unique 'cel-shaded' 3D models, the characters are well-developed and apparently based on a popular franchise (other than the game I am unfamiliar with the line though). It is a crime story with noir and urban fantasy elements, with a Hugh-Jackman alike protagonist and a suitably attractive female lead. Everything should be great, yes?  Wrong. The problem is the heavy emotional mood. All the characters look and feel heavily traumatized, the nervous music wears you down, their connections never take off. The protagonist never successfully asserts himself -- as soon as he does that, he becomes a monster (the 'Wolf'). The heavy feeling never lifts, up until the finale, I can tell you.  If you look at the wonderful still images, you may miss how much emotional wear and tear this game brings. I have mostly been playing cartoony arcade games to recover after that.  I have been wondering if the depression and trauma is something that comes with the franchise. Still, I will happily play other Telltale games in the future (for me this was a first). If they copy the technical model in a different, more uplifting setting, I will be quite happy.","hours":7.8}

{"funny_percent":0.00603344030619759,"helpful_percent":0.2789446414122235,"review":"Product received for free  Very long review with spoilers below;   TLDR: Interactive story, not a real game. Your choices don't actually matter that much at all, you're being led down a set story line.   I've played through the available episodes three times and yet the story remains incomplete after all this time. Shame.  In this game, you play as a human-looking “Big Bad Wolf” (you know, the antagonist of the Little Red Riding Hood and the Three Little Pigs?), going by the name Bigby Wolf, you are the sheriff of Fabletown, where characters from fables live, hidden from “Mundies” (non-fable characters) by using a cloaking magical spell referred to as “Glamour”... all sorts of well-known characters show up! However, they are NOT the wholesome children’s tale characters you may know from Disney. In fact, this game is VERY MUCH NOT FOR CHILDREN.  It is brutal! As soon as you start playing you can see how not wholesome this adventure will be! There is prostitution, gruesome violence and practically non-stop smoking! (seriously I haven’t seen this many cigarettes being smoked in a video game ever).  As you are well known to be the “Big Bad Wolf”, the residents of Fabletown are less than comfortable with you being sheriff and for good reason! You are a violent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! But then again, so is almost every other person you encounter. Being told to “be nice” gets old after a while, especially if you’ve taken an effort to chose diplomacy in lieu of violence at every opportunity.  The game is set as a choose-your-own-adventure game where your choices affect future gameplay but it’s not very functional, the same results come out of different approaches with only slight differences that often don't even impact the storyline at all.   The story begins like this: You get a call to see about a domestic dispute of sorts. You go upstairs to find the Woodsman (your archenemy) beating on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You kick the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of him (and he also kicks the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you) until finally she sticks his own ax in the back of his head and walks away after a chit chat with you. (She explains that Fables, like you all are, are hard to kill and that he’ll be alright). Later on, you find a severed head on your apartment building’s doorstep. Snow White and you start to investigate and she asks you “who do you think did it?”. Now the story expects you to say the Woodsman and that’s what I said the first time around. However, the second time around, I talked to the ♥♥♥♥♥ for a bit before she walked away and she expressed fear and concern over her pimp. So I told Snow White that I suspected it was her pimp who did it. The story continues and as you find more information you eventually decide to go to the bar to talk to the Woodsman, see if he knows something. Sitting in a cab with Snow White you say “He might have information, and he is still a suspect” and she says “Our ONLY suspect” ♥♥♥♥♥ what??? He is NOT our only suspect and he’s not even our prime suspect! What happened to finding out about her pimp huh? After interviewing her fiance which we managed to find alive we even found out his name was Georgie! Why focus on the Woodsman instead of finding Georgie??   At another point you were interrogating a suspect and Bluebeard punched him out. No matter if you restrained Bluebeard or not, people will treat this instance as if YOU beat up the tied suspect… inconsistencies like these happened throughout the game that although annoying, didn’t really ruin the whole story... becase the story was to happen as it does happen.  Inconsistencies in your choices and how the story is not actually really modified by it (when the game promotes itself on being one of those games where your choices REALLY affect the story and even says so at the start of the first episode) really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. 1. Because it happened more than once 2. Because it happened in a way that could not be ignored, as part of the main (only?) quest. There are not many branches to the story line, the choices you make that do have an effect are few and far between.   The gameplay is constant like a film. Your dialogue options must be chosen within a certain timeframe or else your character will answer with an awkward silence. Battles are similar in that if you don’t press the buttons that pop up on screen in a given time, then your character did nothing and will probably have their face bashed in by enemies. There is a certain amount of leniency in battles that make them pretty hard to \"fail\".   I mean, the game is fun enough, especially the first time and I really enjoyed it but more and more I see extreme flaws with it. Even the fighting system which I was originally impressed with is not as cool as I thought it was and turns out to be not really existent… It doesn't have much replayability at all (even though I have completed several playthroughs)  The art in this interactive story is very appealing. It is very cartoon-y like a comic book would be. The voice acting is superbly high quality and the story is gripping. However, there are certain few glitches that occurred during game play which required me to reboot the game a few times while I was playing.   I am not giving this a good rating because of the lack of further available game play. I didn’t realize the game was not “finished” when I bought it (OVER TWO YEARS AGO!) and I was disappointed to completely finish in only 8 hours (There has been NO new added content since the date of purchase).   I would NOT recommend this game at full price. It is not a real game, it is an interactive story - and an incomplete one at that!   I would recommend this game if it ever comes on sale to those who would like to view an interesting interactive story without the idea of getting any sort of closure at the end of it.","hours":21.1}
