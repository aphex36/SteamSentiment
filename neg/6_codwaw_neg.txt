The inaccuracy spread is way too high and the game forces you to use iron sights (or ADS) for accurate shots...I hate iron sights and never use it in any game, it makes it harder for me to aim that way...  The game difficulty, on just Normal, is way too hard for any average player to understand what they should be doing.   Game gives no warning for grenades and they explode too fast.  I have detected no form of cover system to be able to hide and being out in the open is a very quick death sentence, again on just Normal difficulty.   Should probably cut down on how many controls there are... several unneeded functions.   This review was made before getting passed the first level. Negative feedback is not wanted.  I love how I can give valid points that people could use to stray away from this game but get downvoted by fanboys anyway. A study showed fanboyism is actually a problem.","hours":0.4}
