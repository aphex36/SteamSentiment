Speaking for myself, I completed the game (without the speedrun challenges) in about 5 hours. I'm sure that at the time of release, when indie games were sparse (and in particular, the platformer-with-a-twist genre hadn't been run into the ground), this was a fairly groundbreaking title. We all know about the hype it generated, at least.  So in short, the game's puzzles offer an interesting challenge, but there aren't very many of them. It probably isn't worth $14.99 as of 2017.

I’ve heard its story also gets very interesting near the end. Though I don’t personally recommend Braid, I can definitely understand why some people love it.  Why don’t I enjoy Braid? - Quality puzzles thrust upon clueless players • Each world in Braid introduces completely different Game-Changing concepts. However the game provides very few opportunities to practice and learn those new game mechanics before throwing the player into its most complicated puzzles. Each world gives a couple simple rooms and then expects the player to understand its difficult, final puzzles.  • The player can bypass specific puzzles, but that’s not usually a valid option. Skipping one only increases frustration in the future, since the knowledge from a skipped puzzle is often needed to do the rest in that world.  • There are some puzzles that just aren’t realistic for the player to solve without hours of tedious experimenting, or having to abandon your skills by just looking up the answers.  Overall: Braid has some very interesting gameplay ideas, and a beautiful presentation, but it really deserves more levels so players can learn and challenge themselves gradually. Running into constant dead ends made Braid too frustrating/boring for me to recommend, and I do usually enjoy puzzle games.","hours":6.1}

Things start out deceptively simple, then become increasingly more challenging as you go on. Eventually, I was having to check online for a couple of solutions, and replaying levels is apparently mandatory to actually get the ending. If you do not 100% all the puzzles, you may as well not have played at all.  Portal 2 had one puzzle I had to look up online, and I regret having done that to this day, because I feel like I could've figured it out eventually. With Braid, however, I felt pretty helpless with these puzzles, and if I'd looked up a bunch of puzzle solutions, we're back to \"I may as well have not played at all.\" Everyone kept talking about the darn thing,so my curiosity got the better of me and I gave the game a go, but I wish I hadn't wasted by time with it. I loved the Portal Games, enjoyed The Turing Test and Red Trigger, and generally enjoy puzzles, but I did not like Braid's puzzles and found them too obtuse to figure out. I solved all the puzzles I could without looking up a bunch of solutions online, and was left with far too many puzzles I couldn't solve on my own. If I looked up that many solutions online for a game of this size, I would've hated myself for quite a while.  I think The Turing Test handled this sort of thing far better. You don't have to 100% everu puzzle in the game to win. There is a series of puzzles you must complete to win, but the crazy-hard puzzles are optional and just net you achievements/bragging rights if you can solve them.","hours":2.4}

I have no complaints regarding the art, music, and story. A few of the puzzles are a little wonky to me, but overall they are very well made and really make you think.  The problem comes when mechanics besides move, jump, and activate are introduced. The game gives zero indication of how the rules of each level work; you just have to figure it out yourself. While I'm all for letting the player discover the limits of what they can do, giving zero indication of what can be done is where I draw the line. For example in world 6, you gain a new ring power. A ring is referneced in the intro to the world, but indication is given that it is an ability, much less what button it is on. Once you figure out the rules it is ok.  This absolute lack of direction in a game with surprisingly complex mechanics simply left me feeling lost and frustrated. I almost ragequit a couple times, but I got through. It would just be so much better with a simple 1-2 line tutorial. Or even just introduce the next set of rules in the previous level in an obvious, easy to understand way.

There are a few clever abilities that were novel at the time of the game's release, but the fundamental idea of time travel as a gameplay mechanic had been done before, and in my opinion, done better by other games. For instance, while Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time may not have had as many different time travel mechanics, I feel that it did a better job of actually leveraging them to create engaging gameplay. Braid quickly beings to feel repetitive; in fact, some of the content is literally repeated in the latter half of the game, but with a few minor tweaks. I also felt the puzzle design was hit-and-miss, with trial-and-error being the best way to solve many of the later puzzles.  Oh, and the story is pretentious nonsense. I find it thoroughly annoying when a story is praised for its depth and subtelty when in fact it's just purposefully obfuscated and noncommittal.

From the starting sequence, I was in love, it started so simply control was instinctual move and jump, got it! I was engaged, the emotion you can feel in it narrative, is real. This game served as an emotional outlet for its creator and that element of Braid makes it feel very sacred. That is where my love affair with Braid begins and ends.  Braid loses me when the time control function comes into play. I have gotten no introduction to this mechanic. it is just all the sudden mandatory to move forward. This now feels like the first REAL OKG review. This mechanic and the way it controls both on screen and on the controller have ended my experience with this game.  Here is what this actually looks like, I am sorry I don't have a stream, that is coming soon. Play along with me though.  Camera fades from black and iris open to a wide angle shot. Liz is sitting facing her monitor, controller in hands, grin on face and feet at the ready under her chair.  The soft hum of in-game music can be heard in contrast to the clicking of nails against a plastic controller. Full attention is focused on the monitor that glows before her. As you watch Tim, the on-screen avatar bounce around platforms and off enemy heads you can see Liz hold her breath and her mouth tense just a little each time she presses the jump button to send Tim soaring.  She is still progressing but the grin has faded and her shoulders have rolled forward . Then she gets here, this screen shows the end of this game for our Okayest Gamer, Liz Cooper.  So what does OKG say?  So after experiencing my masochistic attempts at progress in this game, what do you think I am going to say here? If you are an OKG like me, there is a chance this mechanic might catch you up too, but maybe not. I would try a friend's copy before buying to see if you are all clear, or maybe just add to Steam Wishlist and get when on deep discount during a sale.  If you do not have OKG tendencies, then you are a lucky devil and in for a wonderful experience. I have watched youtube playthroughs of more successful players, and it is a fantastic game with such emotionally strong narrative.

I found it far too difficult, to the point where it was so difficult it just wasn't fun at all. Most of the puzzle solutions felt like exploits rather than solutions. Which I think I'd be OK with if the game wasn't real-time with penalty for failure. All of the different time-based gameplay mechanics were interesting and playing around with their implementations was pretty cool, and the puzzles were extremely well-designed - this game is a classic example of introducing some reasonably simple mechanic and then wringing every last gameplay idea out of it just like Nintendo is pretty good at. Only problem is that it just wasn't actually fun.  I thought the graphics were... bad (I've never seen something that looked like it was drawn in MS Paint AND looked horribly blurry before), and the music was annoying (not the fault of the music per se but just the fact that it's bound to be annoying when you're constantly rewinding it, pausing it, speeding it up, slowing it down...). The \"story\" was unintelligible garbage like Hotline Miami - there's metaphorical and then there's just noise.  I suppose if you come at this game with the idea that the only thing you want is a sequence of increasingly difficult real-time puzzles, and you're happy that the game will give you absolutely nothing except those puzzles, and you don't already have a headache, you could enjoy it just fine. But silly me, I tried to pay attention to the story, I expected low-stress areas between high-stress areas, I expected the game to explain its mechanics to me (don't need to explain everything, but the arbitrary/esoteric corner cases of the less obvious abilities, that are necessary for progression? yes), and I already had a headache when I started.","hours":9}

Standard puzzle game with platforming elements. Braid is charming in its aesthetic; that's for sure. Classical music plays as you traverse levels filled watercolored backdrops. It has the presentation down, yeah, but its a shame that the rest of the game really doesn't hold up to my standards.  A puzzle game lives or dies on its difficulty curve. If puzzles are set up logically, with difficulty that builds over time, then that's standard. However, Braid introduces new mechanics, and then immediately expects you apply these mechanics in extraordinary ways. The game will typically give you one dead simple level, and then dumps you into a level where you need to apply something uncommonly or use a trick to get through. No thanks. And while I'm ragging on level design, something feels off about this. Levels are usually longer affairs, with several different separate puzzle compartments. This feeling is exacerbated the longer the game goes on. Really, the idea of having levels as a sort of divider seems more natural and cohesive to me. If puzzles have nothing to do with eachother except that the same mechanics are being used, then why shove them on the same map? I'm not entirely sure what the intent was.  I'll be more blunt, Braid is a time waster. Every puzzle in Braid could probably be solved by anyone if they were given enough time to mess around with it. The amount of time you need to waste to get through would vary though. I simply don't have the patience to just waste time until I somehow solve the puzzle. Trying things until you have the solution is not logical. There is no process, the way I see it. There are just some things the game expects you to know. In a game like Dark Souls, that might be passable, but this has no excuses. If a puzzle game doesn't lay itself out in a logical way, there isn't any way to complete it without a walkthrough, or an excess of time to burn. That's a no-no.  I guess I'm more lukewarm on this because I've played more interesting puzzle games that feel like less of a waste. The aesthetic is nice, but can we really justify the puzzles when flash games have been around for so much longer? I guess that's my biggest complaint. This entire thing feels like a flash game I had to pay money for. It's older, sure. But like I said, that doesn't hold water when older games did the genre more justice. The Prince of Persia time mechanics are cool and all, but they don't exactly hold the game up on their own. Later mechanics feel even worse when they begin piling on top of eachother. Unless you got the time to burn, you'll probably end up looking up a walkthrough.  Speaking of wasting time, I'll mention the books in the clouds. There's several in every room before the start of each world. I felt robbed, because functionally, these books are worthless. Sure, they provide some color to the game, but anyone who's beaten the game will agree that they're really pointless fluff; akin to books found in the Elder Scrolls games. I'd recommend just ignoring them entirely or just being savvy of intentional misdirection by the game developer. Thanks.  What else is there to say. Fairly standard puzzling, with a neat little aesthetic. It's ok for what it's worth, sure. I wouldn't exactly call it time well spent. That ending really sealed the deal for me. Instead of making the twist too obvious, Braid decides to lead you on, and then completely switches on you last level. And all this to one of the most played out twists in the book. There are better puzzle games.","hours":9.3}

I thought this game would be fun with the time manipulation concepts but I am finding all of it confusing and tedious, making it really hard to enjoy the game. I feel like the mechanics are just throwing themselves all at once at me and the developer is just expecting the player to know what to do instinctively. When I do get something working, often I feel it was just through dumb luck more so than analyzing the situation and executing to see if my strategy would work. This could have been avoided if the concepts were introduced better and how to take advantage of each one.  I also feel that the game is cheating me, like I obtain a key and then I lose it if I backtrack (not rewind). I do realize that a green \"aura\" object or enemy is immune to time manipution, but other things, such as moving right makes enemies \"play forward\" while moving left makes enemies \"play backwards\", isn't clearly marked. I think that particular key is that kind of object but I just gave up after not understanding why I was losing the key.  For some reason, the game likes to shift between 30 and 60FPS. This isn't frame skipping. This is kind of annoying because the game started out slow and then suddenly became faster and then become slow again. I don't understand why.  I do applaud the developers for trying to do something ambitious but I don't think it was designed well in execution. It might be an indie game and not a AAA game, but that doesn't automatically mean good.

I loved Limbo so thought this might be similarly enjoyable, especially considering great reviews for this puzzle/platformer. Bottom line: I did not enjoy the puzzle experience at all, and the controls and level design were more frustrating than fun to play.   I don't know, there's so many good reviews I thought for sure I'd find something to like, but ... nope. Some reviews mention needing to use mechanics you don't know you have sometimes, so maybe that's part of it. I don't know. Played about 50 minutes and stopped to reread some reviews thinking maybe I'd misunderstood. Sadly, am requesting a refund. ;-( This thumbs down is unexpected - a high profile \"miss\" for me that I was confident I'd enjoy.","hours":0.8}

Introudces a gameplay concept only to have it fail to work in next two puzzles and expect you to try it on 3rd puzzle but not 4th. Trying it on the 2 puzzle will get you stuck completely for no apparent reason.  I cheated for a couple puzzles; not one made me go \"Ahh okay I see now\", the solution was always \"How the ♥♥♥♥ was I supposed to know that?\" .","hours":1.2}

It`s nice, it`s ok but nothing special. And the story is mediocre at best.","hours":6.3}
