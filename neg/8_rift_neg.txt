I have been an active player in RIFT since it became F2P and I have played and enjoyed it far more than the hours here on steam as I have mainly run it via Glyph.  I can not recommend this game to anyone, if you have not heard about this game or of Trion I will save you a lot of time/money and say \"go play something else\". The company does not take the playerbase seriously, they dismiss concerned players as trolls or griefers or tell us to go play something else if we ask for them to fix the unbalanced pvp or gamebreaking bugs.   I used to raid and do pvp both hardcore and later casually as the game became more and more grindy and kept locking new content like specs you needed to minmax if you want to be competetive and even gear slots behind paywalls. (They have later on made the gear slots available without spending $)  Raids during SL the 2.0 RIFT was great, they were so interesting with great stories which tied in well with the main storyline and the characters. Mechanically it was challenging, but the most \"difficult\" mechanic is interrupting bosses in time. In 2.0 there was also PVP gear which gave you increased damage and surivability in PVP which was something we could work our way towards as we did PVP and levelled up Prestige rank.  Then came 3.0 and things started to decline, more soul packs and a calling behind a paywall, earrings (gear slot) behind a paywall. Of course, when I say paywall it is perfectly possible to grind in-game plat to buy RL currency pack called REX which contains ingame credits. There used to be a lot of efficient ways of farming plat, which all got nerfed quite hard to fix inflation apparently.  During the 3.0 expansion there were several gamebreaking bugs and exploits in raids which were reported to developers during testing and when it came on live server it was still not fixed. Some of the top-end guilds killed the bosses using these bugs and well they all got banned and are now playing WoW or something.  Raidscene in rift at current is pretty much non-existent, each expansion releases fewer and fewer raids, and less original raids and dungeons, most are re-skins or just up-scaled dungeons/raids.  Which brings us to the latest and current expansion. Starfall prophecy, or wait, Prophecy of Ahnket. (Apparently they did not want to be confused with a children's charity with a similar name.  There was an announced change of payment model, from F2P to B2P if you wanted to experience what was in the new expansion, which takes place on a comet in space! With life and fire themed zones, much wow very content such impressed wow original.   This was not very popular with the playerbase, especially seeing as the last 6-8 months before this expansion had been pretty void of any real content and what had been released was as usual full of bugs and has a feeling of being unpolished. So they tried to entice the gullible player by promising to release a highly polished game with all new exciting features and everything is so awesome and there will be this and this and this and wow it will be great so come and buy it now preorder and get these extra shinies!  I stuck around for a while without buying the expansion, as did most of my guild. Not a lot of players bought the expansion and after a year or so? They made it free for everyone who logged in during a weekend. Then they ran a sale on it and then a few months later they made it free for all. As I have been raiding in this game for years and a guild leader of one of the largest casual community raiding guilds on Zaviel I have quite a large friends list, and most of that friends list is still full of people who have moved to other games instead of getting back to this game where they just know they will get screwed over again.  The actual expansion they released was a few new zones, with some original mobs, a lot of reskins and no new pvp maps, no raids until several months in and that was a easy mode raid, same requirements as an expert dungeon. Of the 4 dungeons they released, 2 were upscaled versions of old dungeons and 2 were original, the 2 original ones had some bugs so one was disabled for some time. Then was released again and they are still bugged to this day, developers claim they are unable to re-produce the bugs that players have been documenting quite well on the in-house servers. Which just proves that the devs don't actually play their own game.  There is always some grinding in this kind of game, but with 4.0 it just went insane.   In the current expansion they are doing something called \"active upgrades\" which basically does 2 things: suck you dry of plat and time.  Once you get to max level you do a quest to get a weapon which you will use for the whole of this expansion, this weapon takes a significant amount of time to upgrade as well as some challenges. There is also a timegate, where you have to spend 2-3 weeks levelling a minion, an in-game minigame with cards. Then you have to do 100 expert dungeons, and you have a whole 4 dungeons to choose from! wow your eyes will bleed and your ears will fall off from the horrible voice acting! Great joy! The longest step is to kill an end boss in one of the raids (an upscaled raid) 16 times, the raid has a weekly lockout so you are limited to 1 kill per week assuming you get to kill it every week you are looking at 4 months to do 1 upgrade.  Other gear you can upgrade quicker assuming you have the plat, and if you don't have the plat well then you can just swipe your credit card and buy a REX and sell it, then you can upgrade your gear. Win win?  Plat, brings us to something called planar fragments, which is an RNG system that satan himself would be proud of. If you want to do any kind of content which is not dimension(player housing) you need to spend a lot of platinum on upgrading and a lot of time on finding these planar fragments. 99% of them are completely worthless and your inventory will be filled up with them in no time at all. You can get these fragments from almost all content, but the fragments are level 0 or level 1 I don't remember, and you need to get them to level 15 to get the max stats you can from them.  It takes thousands of plat to get them to any useful level and if you want to raid well you need to spend tens of thousands on them, and being a normal casual player doing all content that kind of money is not going to be easy to attain within any reasonable timeframe. Which leaves the only \"viable\" option to swipe your credit card.  I can honestly not recommend this game to anyone, and with the current playerbase being as low as it is, and the developers and community mangers as they are, it is not a game I think will be around much longer.   Even kings die.  Rift was a king once, now it is ashes.","hours":195.9}

Waste of time and money - It is free so why am I saying it is a waste a waste of money, well DLC are not free, and if you want some expansion in the game like extra bags, more characters etc. you need to buy slots, in fact you need to buy a lot of things, but technically you can farm platinum ingame and then use it to buy rex, the problem is not many people are selling rex, or buying it from the devs, I have my doubts about whether the devs are manipulating the market so that people play to earn platinum, and they stimulate the economy. Likewise not many people are using the auction house to buy things.  For me the next problem is the number of leechers, and am not talking about the guy on the phone or the guy who went bio, I am talking about doing a raid with 80% of the party made up of leechers, so that they get more loot, able to roll on epic drops etc. and same time power level characters. It does my head in when it is only 5 of us active in a 20 man raid and anyone you report as afk, simply becomes active and the character he was playing then goes inactive, vicious circle.  Up to lvl 64, levelling is a breeze, level 64 half way on and suddenly the game becomes a chore, at each successive level it gets more and more difficult to level.   I like the concept of IA, immediate adventures, but they are limited and you end up grinding the same things over and over again, so there is a content issue, storyline is limited and boring and I am comparing that to the other 16+ mmporpg I have played or beta tested, I started beta testing with wow and moved on from there after 7 years...I am not comparing this game to wow, and I am not claiming wow is the best or anything, but there are several things that wow has learned from other games and the same cannot be said for RIFT.  Support are really good in the game, response time is good, though often not what you want to hear, like we had a combat bug, I reported it, GM told me it was not an issue and then they had to patch it because it got so bad and there was a public outcry (laugh), customer services are friendly, community is amazingly helpful and polite, so why the negativety from me?  Current problem they are blaming on DDoS, denial of service, but no fix in sight, this started at the last 2 patches and then they patched on top of the bug, same bug has been around since 2011, 2013, 2015 and now 2017 each time it creeps back in, I think it is too convenient that this time it is a ddos...  Bug reporting is ridiculous, it is on the same form as feedback reporting no option to link anything, am sure there is another menu you could go to that allows this, but the fact that they have several different methods of bug reporting just speaks to how useless it is. The GM response to the bug report is to tell you it does not exist, no such bug, and then if there are sufficient numbers of people reporting the same, they will claim to fix it during maintenance. So far everytime they patch something, something else goes wrong.  Crafting, you get something called a crafting lure once per week on getting crafting to 500-525 (note this is limited to one lure only for the week, not one lure per craft you have at level 500+), which basically means you can do one crafting rift per week before you start needing IP, IP are charges you get for the week that allow you to collect loot drops. So you get a maximum of 2 loot drops per week per instance and then you have to use charges, for me I had been waiting the whole week for my charges to reset, and then discovered you only get 10/100 at reset.  So if you do a farming run in a raid, even if it is not saved progress, it blocks the whole instance from farming, so Tartaric depths on easy mode gets you 2 opportunities to loot after that you have to use charges, loot is random and often no items drop, so you need charges, you can buy more charges in the store for real money ie credits/rex, theoretically you could use rex, but 50 charges would cost you 2040 credits, which is the equivalent of about 1.75 times of rex.  End game content, limited, I actually had to turn off the character speech it is so annoying, and I had to ask in general chat how to do this, which everyone as usual was very quick to help out with, they have all done it...pvp almost non existent, but not to worry, this week they are releasing a patch to increase dps...devs so out of touch with the community it seems.","hours":539.7}

And conceptually, Rift has got it going on. So many great things--especially the class/souls system. I love being able to switch roles at the drop of a hat, and exploring different builds without having to create and level an entirely separate character. Within hours I was planning on going paid ($15/month subscription, Patron), and was already working on arguments to get old guildies and gamer family members involved.   The game, however, is almost--ALMOST--unplayable. First, the bugs. GLARING bugs. Special events items do not function at all, or only half the time. Then there's the functionality of the game itself. Not only can I run only on lowest specs, where everything looks like colored blurs, and not only is the fps rate still so low that I feel like I'm having a seizure every time I try to mount up and ride, but the game has been disconnecting and booting everyone (not just me!) for days now, with nary a word on plans for a fix. Instead, our patch made a few minor character/role/soul adjustments, and that was it. I can go maybe 20 minutes without being booted, most of the time in the middle of a time-sensitive event. Instances? Raids? Ha, forget it.   There is laziness somewhere in this chain, and Trion is grossly mismanaging a well-loved game with plenty of players and unique features. Had I been involved in this project, I would be infuriated witht the way this game has been handled. I would love to become a paying player, because yes, there is excellent content here, and I want to support a game that thinks outside the box. There is a ton of content, lots of opportunities for coop and community building, and plenty of other positive things. But all of that doesn't make a difference if I can't play the game for more than 20 minutes at a stretch, and when I do play (on bare minimum settings, on a laptop that, yes, is older, but has proven more than capable of handling mmos) I can't even properly enjoy because the performance is so poor.   So, as much as I would like to recommend this game, as much as I would like to tell you to join and subscribe and play around with all the soul combos, and do the instant adventure raid groups, etc., I can't. It's a waste of money, and until I see a shred of evidence that the developers actually care about the community and the overall gaming experience and will FIX things rather than slapping a bandage over things, I'm not spending another penny.

The other points you can divide between two other 'souls' of your choosing, from your 'class'. The obvious decision is to maximize one of those two, so as to have access to the highest level abilities and traits as is possible given the number of points you have available. The third soul being there just for a gimmick really, like the charge dash ability, or perhaps stealth. And it is really nearly a default selection of souls, after the first soul, the second being whichever one most capably supports the first soul, with synergistic traits and abilities, such as both boosting fire damage, just as an example. The thrid soul is mostly irrelevant. So, the first soul is just whichever one you want to be your dominant style, mostly cosmetic, as they are (presumably) all balanced. It comes down to your playstyle, do you want close melee or ranged attacks, etc. The second soul is whichever supports the first the best, so basically default, with your selections going to whatever your chosen playstyle is, the nature of the first soul, such as focusing on dps or tanking, etc. And the third soul is mostly irrelevant. Let me know if this is not correct, meaning if they have ACTUALLY improved things. My suspicion is that things remain the same as they were, just with more cosmetic crap like new souls that only really look different, with different animations, different style, like some character that throws spitballs instead of shooting fire. ...  more below in comments (steam having trouble posting m y review)","hours":27.2}

Now, the game is a pretty great time up until level cap.  Most MMORPGs have you grinding tokens or reputation at endgame. Rift has you grinding both, but also a third dimension: grinding gold to buy paid currency, or buying paid currency with money. You need the cash shop currency to unlock classes and additional content. If it was only cosmetics, well, that would be a different story. As evidenced by other reviews, having to grind or buy your way into new content (the cash shop content, not tokens or rep) makes players lose interest, because it simply is not fun or intuitive. Particularly not when you're already grinding reputation and tokens.  It's not the cash shop itself causing players to leave, it's just a side effect of how the whole system plays out.

{"funny_percent":0.07027321164099233,"helpful_percent":0.015447687048047998,"review":"SPOILERS AHEAD,,, WALL OF TEXT AHEAD RIFT, reviewed by doomgiver, aka Kaali, aka Snowbuns, aka Sunderwear, aka Fuklaw, aka Trinopls aka Iwasbannedforthis a very special thank you to Finnabar (may he live a thousand years) for solving my latency problem. Finn, you're a GOD.  I am bitter, angry, sad and feeling betrayed as I click the \"not recommended button\".  I started playing RIFT in August 2013, just as it went F2P.  It was my first MMO.  It was MAGICAL.  Everything was amazing. I could roam around a large world (at that time, it was HUGE), randomly meet people in the open world,♥♥♥♥♥♥talk in chat, make friends, nemeses, join guilds, make alts, basically, have fun exploring the game.  I have a TON of alts. I have 4 different accounts, all with atleast one level 60 char, some with more.  I have played this game for several thousand hours.  I have raided at the top and almost-top level in 2.0 and 3.0 on almost all classes.  I enjoyed it.  Then why do I not recommend this game?  One word : TRION WORLDS  The SINGLE reason why Rift is so s#it today. This company is filled with greedy idiots who dont care about their customers. All they care about is money.  Rift was OK when it went F2P. Some loudmouthed anti-f2p idiots who believed it would tank left the game. I say, good riddance.  Cash shop  The cash shop was a tiny bit overpriced, however, it was acceptable. Not everything was supposed to be affordable.  Then Trion introduced lockboxes. Simple, harmless boxes that could contain a random variety of loot. Except, they usually contain worthless items. Well, a sucker is born every minute.  Then they introduced raiding gear for credits. WTF trino? they said it was \"only\" 2nd best (one tier below what was the \"TOP\" tier), and the best would NEVER be on sale for money (heavy emphasis on this)  In the end of 2.0, trion released some item sets on the store THAT WERE BETTER WAAAAAY BEYOND WHAT PLAYERS COULD OBTAIN AT THAT TIME. Trino brushed it off by saying, roughly \"This gear is better than what you have in 2.0, but in 2 weeks, 3.0 will be here and this gear will be equal to 3.0 dungeon gear\".  Instantly, anybody worth his raid spot got his wallet out and paid for the gear. Afterall, who wouldnt want to get a leg-up on the competitive ladder?  But its just dungeon gear, innit? Who cares? WE DO. The people who grind dungeons to gear up for raids. It was a slap in the face. But thats no biggie. any jackass can buy gear, but not every jackass can pull 30k dps in random blues.  At the end of 3.0, trino did something sneaky. they made the vendor bought armor and weapons SLIGHTLY better (5-10% difference) than what the bosses dropped. so, if you wanted BIS gear, you HAD to farm up the tokens and upgrade your gear. In the past, you could simply gear up either by buying items from vendors or getting a raid drop. Both items were roughly equal (less than 1% difference in stats... both ways... so sometimes boss dropped item was better, sometimes vendor armor was better... by a few points... but it was a balance of sorts)  And in 4.0, trino has straight up put BIS gear in the store.  Som people might not like it. I like it. let the suckers buy the items. it wont help them one bit. Ive seen too many store item baddies who can barely pull more dps than the fricken tank. HAHAHAHAHAHA.  Skill > Gear in rift.  Yup.  World events/special events  Then they started ♥♥♥♥ing around with World Events. For those who dont know, they are once-a-year special events, with special and unique rewards, like, mounts, wardrobe items, consumables, pets etc.  You participate in those events and get event currency, which you can use to buy those items I mentioned. ORRR you can spend $$$ to get them ASAP. You know where this is going.  Every year, there were more and more items in the \"Premium\" tab, which could ONLY be bought with $$$. Since 4.0, they have put almost EVERYTHING worth buying in the Premium section. I see no reason to do events now, since I have bought everything I could with the currency.  Alts  It was very easy to maintain an army of alts in 2.0. A few platinum for a full set of crafted armor, a few platinum for a full set of runes, and you could start doing dungeons right away. If you were super poor, or wanted a challenge, you could hit up the daily chronicles (1 or 2 man repeatable instances) for gear and money.  It was very cheap to raid, a few plat would give you enough raiding consumables to comfortably last a month.  I was doing almost full clear of all T1 raids, most bosses of T2 and 3/4 minibosses of T3 on 7 characters, 3 of whom were on NA side. My top character had fully cleared T1, T2 and 4/4 minibosses in T3 and 2/4 main bosses in T3.  With 3.0, trino released Nightmare Tide, a new expansion. It got harder to maintain alts. Crafted gear got several times more expensive, it took longer to levelup alts, there were fewer raids happening.  I still managed to clear most of T1 and T2 with 3 of my alts. The rogue and cleric were essentially mothballed at this point. I stopped playing when T3 came out. It was starting to get really grindy.  With 4.0, trino released Prophecy of Ahknet, nee Starfall Prophecy, a new expansion. Alts are extremely ♥♥♥♥ING hard to levelup.  Heck, I've given up at this point. Just pick a single char to take to 70. if you want to level up more, you're either a madman or truly desperate. or just plain insane.  Raids I enjoyed T2 in 2.0 (storm legion, SL). it had very interesting fights that you couldnt simply brain afk or brute force. you HAD to deal with the mechanics.  T1 of 3.0 was filled with bugs (remember threngar?) T2 of 3.0 was a complete copy paste of an old 1.0 raid. 90% of it was the exact same. only the soulstealer fight was different (the tall hot death-themed harpy chick, whatever her name was)  T1 of 4.0 is somewhat disappointing. I cant say mch as i have only raided a few times, but it didnt leave a negative impression on me, thats all i know.  wardrobes  rift's wardrobe system is the BEST i've seen till date. however, it is very clunky to find and unlock skins, especially since many items have been \"removed\" from the game, with no way of ever getting them again. case in point : a wardrobe focused guild had to farm 4 MONTHS to unlock a single level 15 shield design, because nobody knew where it dropped and they had to kill everything to make it drop.  another case in point : there's a chest armor that ONLY drops in the starting area, from ONE mob, who only spawns for god knows what reason. the only way i got that skin was because i was RP'ing for several hours in the starting area with my friend, and this skeleton boss mob popped up for some reason, and neither of us had ever seen him, so we killed him and got the chest armor reward.  god only knows how many skins are locked behind weird♥♥♥♥♥♥like this.  BUT, once you unlock a skin, you can use it on ANY char!!! for free!! not like guild wars (FK YOU GUILD WARS, THIS IS THE #1 REASON WHY I QUIT THE GAME.) and you dont even have to stick t othe armor weight!!! mages can look like heavily armored knights, and warriors can run into battle wearing a skirt!!  A special Thank You to Mists of Steel (for raid training me), Asthapartim (for being a fun friend), Yobiraion (for tolerating a noob cleric), Apotheosys (for giving me my big break), Last Dawn (for being really nice about parking my alt), Fires of Heaven (for supporting a noob warrior), Finnabarr (for basically solving ALL my problems... i could give this guy a bj if i could), Balls of Steel (for showing me how to actually pvp), Nefarious (again, for allowing me to park my alt) and all the lovely people on NA, including Fate Called and Mistakes were Made (NOT YOU, SEASTONE... joking :D) and most of EU (you know who) for making my stay enjoyable.  If I missed you, please dont be mad, I only have so many words.  tl:dr : WAS good. WAS. not anymore","hours":3.7}
