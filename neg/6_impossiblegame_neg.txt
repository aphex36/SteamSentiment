Gameplay wise, it’s not that bad; after all, this was the style of game that inspired Geometry Dash. Also, don’t get me wrong, it can be addictive; when I got this game on my iPod touch back in 2011 I was playing the heck out of it. However, there is very little replay value as there are only four levels, and although there is a level editor, there is no easy way to browse and play levels that other people have made.  The main reason I’m not recommending this game is because of how poorly optimised this game is for PC – the game constantly freezes on some frames and skips some frames, making it borderline unplayable for me to play it.  So in closing, if you’re looking for a game like this that has much more levels, a lot more elements to it, a fantastic soundtrack and spectacular visuals, get Geometry Dash instead (Not to mention – it is cheaper!) But if you really want to get the Impossible Game, get it on Xbox or a mobile device as it is a fraction of the price and runs so much better.","hours":0.4}

An orange square has to complete a sequence of jumps over spikes and abysses in a quite high velocity. Unfortunately the square is not controllable in the air. That means wrong started sequences lead to dead in the end. And all your progress is lost. Tho you must play every level with starting/continue flags, but then also the complete level without using any flags. The jump sequences are quite risky and each mistake kills. There are also mean mechanics where you must jump downstairs on blocks without a chance to estimate how much millisecs or millimeters you will loose on each jump. That would not be such a problem if the rendering was so laggy and the controls were instead superprecise. But that isn't the case. So the impossible game stays impossible to me ...","hours":3.8}
