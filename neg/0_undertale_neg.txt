{"review":"Ever since this game came out, the community has become a sh*t spree of bad community, its just bronies but with undertale memes, i don't like any of the characters in this game, heck if i \"Was\" frisk i would do a true pacifist route, not because im nice, its just doing that and exposing these characters to humans is gonna put them through hell. Sans is the charcter i hate the most. everybody wants his d*ck even though hes a f*cking skeleton, his humor is extermelly terrible and makes no sense, of course all these undertale fans is gonna dislike this because im taking the sh*t out of a game. i didn't find the RPG aspect fun either, it just felt like i was doing a chore. papyrus was a terrible charcter and was not funny. the way he acted was very kiddish and doesn't display a fun attitude. toriel is just at the start to expand the beggining of the game and is a terrible charcter. ever since sans spilled the beans about toriel and him chatting telling stupid puns everyone drew p*rn of them. frisk is just like the doom main character, has no personality and never talks. and chara and asriel. chara has nothing to do with the story whatso ever. asriel doesn't either, they're just there to make the story \"Better\". flowey is the only bad guy in the game, and does the worst out of it. even bowser does a better job. alphys is just a otaku charcter to be like all these anime fans. undyne is oblivous and thinks that anime is real. nothing about this game made me laugh. and the \"Puzzles\" were all extermely easy. just completing this game felt like a chore and i hated it. this also has no realism whatso ever, through all of this fnaf is a better game. and you may say \"BUT IT WAS MADE BY ONE PERSON@!!!\".Toby fox could've done a better game. and did nothing to stop this garbage community. the p*rn always has something to do with sans. like hes saying \"LOL XD\" in the background or getting his d*ck sucked. he has nothing to do with this but everyone loves him. and so i give this game a 1/10 for being terrible. one of the worst games in 2015.","hours":22.6,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.2727272727272727}

{"review":"I know people gush about this game, but I just can't do it. You feel forced into a pacifist’s playstyle, and then must go through the game trying to please people using no logical basis for what you do other than not attack. Certain items, weird music, and other plot points can cause any number of weird, largely confusing things to happen. It’s just not fun. You can spend an exorbitant amount of time learning these tricks, constantly google on the Undertale wiki what to do, or go through the game frustrated like I did because, no matter what you do, you’ll never know what to do for any new situation as the pacification methods are different for each monster, boss, or situational ordeal.  Either destroy everyone throughout the game and get the genocide ending, or don’t play. It’s not worth the ragefest that is having to go through each situation, figure out what you’re supposed to do (usually causing at least one restart), and then load your game, sometimes several steps behind with many minutes lost, to progress.

{"review":"Do you know why I hate Undertale?   Because it's the best game ever made.  The graphics look like they were drawn by a 4 year old, with the talents of Pablo Picasso, in his prime.  Which is what I would have said, if I liked the graphics.   Which I do.   Not.  Narratively, this game is a paragon of interactive storytelling; every choice you make weighs on your conscious, because the connections you make with the characters feel organic.  And that's why I'm giving this game a five out of five...  ...billion. iT ♥♥♥♥ING SUCKS","hours":8.9,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.26666666666666666}
{"review":"So, this is just a quick practical review of what I think about Undertale. I think this game is severely hit and miss. While the game was never unenjoyable to me, in fact, I have been quite enjoying the overall feel and cheekiness of it when I have been trying to play. But the game never hooked it me. The first time I tried it, I played to the end of the snowy town, took a break once I had gotten into the cave and just... never came back to it. I tried again yesterday and, once again, it hasn't been clicking, in fact, this time it didn't click even sooner and the humor had pretty much been drained out of experiencing everything all over again and I was laying down, half asleep, and playing it with one hand before I finally gave it a break.  I'm giving this a \"no\" if only for the lack of a \"I 'unno\"; it does what it wants to well, but for me, to other people who may be like myself, I want to say... no. It is a game that is enjoyable in all aspects of actually playing it to me, but it never gave me a reason to come back to it. Comparing it to games I have been playing recently, it seems like it has a case of wanderlust, or at least, wants to inspire you with one. The save menu jokes actually seem rather potent at this moment because, as a joke, they never gave a reasonable reason to be determined, but yet, at the same time, the actual game in itself gives you no reason to be determined.   Going over the games I have been playing lately, they all have given me something to drive for. Warframe, the gameplay, for the most part, is the main reason to play, but the story-lines are compelling to follow, either because they are well-written and enthralling, or it is intriguing to see what is at the end of the path. Hammerwatch, with its gameplay quite reminescient of a much older game, Gauntlet, is all about finding your way through an unforgiving and deadly dungeon, to see what comes next as you progress deeper through your setting. Fallout: New Vegas puts you as a man left for dead with no memories left after a bullet drilled through your brains, and gives you a dozen different ways to make your own path, with each of them as fleshed out and compelling as the next, whether it is affirming the dominance of either of the two main factions, or merely finding out what happened to you and setting out to aid the other people of the wasteland. Devils Daggers doesn't have much a story, but every moment is a chapter in a horror story, deep, and dark, and perverse, a fight for survival against unearthly, lovecraftian foes who chuckle at your demise and crawl across your senses with the skittering of a million insects and the hollow thunk of hollow bones; every second longer lasted is not only a prolongment of survival, but a new chapter in a terrifically horrific tome sealed with the finality and silence of death.  Undertale? Well, it positions you as a lost human, who needs to find their way back home. The problem? \"Home\" is never developed. For the ruins, it gives you a reason why it is not a good home, despite being inhabited with a strong motherly figure. It's small, it's boring, and it's no way for a child to live. However, the next area is anything but. It has characters of warmth and passion, it has size and depth, and it feels tenfold more alive than the ruins did. Apparently, someone is gonna want us dead, and we really gots to stop 'em... but they're never developed beyond text. As much as it tells you to be determined to go on, as soon as I had completed all that I could in that snowy, little village, it seemed as though I had found anything that could be wanted for a home for my character, and I was done.

I think there are a lot of people who will like this game and then a lot of us that just really never see the point in it. I enjoy single player games where the story is a major element.

{"review":"I wouldn't say this is a terrible game, but I am extremely underwhelmed by it given how popular it is. The writing is good, but the gameplay isn't fun, and no matter how interesting a story is I need to at least enjoy playing the game. A choose your own adventure comic would have been a better format to tell this story, because the \"gameplay\" is almost nonexistant. The puzzles are too simple and the combat is just dodging projectiles for a couple seconds. This is also a really bad game to play if you have carpel tunnel because of all the button pressing you have to do to get through lengthy monologues in very small dialog boxes.  Pros: + Good story + Funny if you like goofy humor + I guess replayability is a pro but I can't bring myself to finish the first game, so I don't think I'll be seeking alternate endings  Cons - Bad level design: you spend way to much time pressing the walk key to traverse long hallways and bridges that serve no purpose - Combat is obnoxious  - Puzzles are not challenging","hours":6.3,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.46153846153846156}

I am sincerely curious).  I knew virtually nothing of UNDERTALE aside from the fact that is had been unexpectedly wildly popular, that is was an unconventional RPG \"with feelings\" and that it looked \"retro\" (and we can probably agree on the ugly side of retro).  So I bought the game, played it until shortly after meeting Toriel, after a few simple fights and solving two puzzles, and I immediately lost interest. I know many would say that I should be more patient and give it more time, but I subscribe to the school of thought that a story - be it a book, film or game - should have a strong opening but instead Undertale greeted me with a dull tutorial, ugly graphics, lame grinding, lamer puzzles and the flattest storytelling.  I watched reviews that praised the humour, the characters and the story, I read the plot on Wikipedia and honestly I don't see anything that makes me want to play this game.

{"review":"Very boring. I used to like this game, but I definitely overhyped it, because it's boring and a lot of the characters are pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sans is definitely the worst character, he's not funny and people like him just because hes edgy. The writing isn't bad, I'll give it that, it's actually pretty good, but the gameplay is just awful. The music is good, but I can't hear it the same way again ever since the fandom decided to go to absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's like FNaF, but I don't hate FNaF as much as I do Undertale. Undertale just makes me angry in a sort of way I can't explain. FNaF is a boring game, but the fandom didn't do anything to it for me. Seriously, this game makes me angry, and it's probably the only game I've played that has done that. Also, the fanbase is SO sensitive you literally can't have an opinion against this game being good without somebody telling you you're wrong. The Pacifist run is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, because it has nearly the same ending as every other one and you need to go on dates and help them with their personal problems with everybody to get the \"true\" ending? What the ♥♥♥♥, does anybody know what \"Pacifist\" means? It has nothing to do with helping people with their personal problems, it literally means you don't hurt anybody.

{"review":"*WARNING* Here comes an unpopular opinion.    I don't like the game, but before you bash me with the hate train which goes \"Chu chu chu!\" with dislikes, hear me out. I didn't understand the hype before playing the game (and I will probably never do), but I decided to give the game atleast a chance since I've bashed the game for a long time without actually playing it. So why did I suddenly test it then? Well I started thinking about the quote \"At least give it a shot/chance.\" and that is the reason I tried playing the game. I also read reviews like Mcgooky's review   Originally posted by Mcgooky:  1. Ignore the cancer fanbase 2. Buy this game 3. Understand why everyone is crazy about this game.   What I'm going to get bashed for:  I didn't put enough time into the game I don't understand the details of the game/games when it comes to: 1. Graphics 2. Storyline   MY answer:  \"I didn't put enough time into the game\"   *Sure, I can somewhat agree to this one. I probably never gave the game the time the game needs, since I've heard that you need to play atleast 10 hours before you find the enjoyment/understand the details of the game. But here are the problems in MY opinion.   1. The biggest problem with this game is how am I suppose to play the game if the game is not interesting from the start. If I want to quit the first minute I start the game how am I going too last 10 hours to then hopfully understand the game. The game probably has one of the best endings ever, which it seems like by the reviews and I can't take that away, since I won't know the ending/endings for now atleast since I'm not playing the game. If I would for an example read a book and I find the first chapter of the book boring how am I supposed to be atracted to continue reading? The answer is: I won't. Which I feel like is the same thing with playing this game.   If we make another example with a game which seems to be completely opposite to Undertale is the game Firewatch (when it comes to endings and the start of the game). Damn I've never been so emotionell at the start of a game. I had tears which ran down my cheek maximum of 10 minutes into the game. Now, I think I've never seen a worse ending of a game when it comes to Firewatch, since the game showed so much potenial and a game that stunning to drop to absolute garbage of an ending. But I guess undertale is the opposite of Firewatch, A game that is complete garbage at the start (Sorry not sorry) which then goes to being the most wonderful game ever.   2. I can barley stand to play this game because of the graphics. It is a 8-bit game, nothing wrong with it being 8-bit there are plenty of 8-bit games out there which looks nice, but this one looks like it has been drawn by a 8 year old. What do I mean by this is that I can't see the \"details\" of the graphics when the graphics are poorly drawn.   3. Storyline, I didn't feel the connection like other people do, but it might be like my first point, I need to put more time into the game. I also don't get how you can be so emotionally active with a \"reading dialogue\".    LAST WORDS  Have I given up on the game?   When I started to write this review the answer was Yes. But when I'm almost done with writing this review I realised something when i reflected on Firewatch and that is that I've played Undertale for about 30 minutes and I feel very unattracted for playing this game, but I think I might be more interested when I finally push through and play these 10 hours and I get this great ending. But I have to take that step and I'm not hyped/ready on doing it.   So will I give Undertale another chance?   Yes, sometime in the future, since I saw other reviews saying that they gave up on the game at first but then played it and enjoyed it.   Will this review get bashed by dislikes?   The answer is probably yes, sadly.   Will I change the review to postive if I manage to enjoy the game?   Yes, Of course.  IF you have any more concerns on how I \"ruin\" this game review score, Or if you want me to kill myself/death threat me because I put a negative review on your favorite game, add me or write a comment.    -Unpopular opinion guy out.","hours":0.4,"funny_percent":0.1,"helpful_percent":0.5}

Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the game quite a bit and adored the soundtrack. Overall, it is a decent game, just boring after a while and quite short, beatable within 4 hours.

The worst aspect of this game is its community of weak-minded fans. Of course, such communities have become common in today's sad state of gaming culture. Even the creator of Undertale expressed regret concerning the unfortunate community that has appeared around it. However, I think he's mostly to blame for this state of affairs considering the amount of anime and weeb influence he brought into his creation.
