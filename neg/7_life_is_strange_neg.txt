{"review":"Horrendous \"Game\"  -Pros   Time-rewind mechanic is atleast somewhat unique to this genre.  Easy achievements if you happen to care about them.  -Cons  \"what if story\" girl gets superpowers never explained why and how but who cares right?  Awful characters Max is basic hipster ♥♥♥♥♥ who enters to artschool and uses old polaroid camera and her \"art\" is mostly selfies because she is so \"unique personality\" Chloe Boo hoo my father died so i act like a♥♥♥♥♥♥(that´s the whole character) and of course lol i use weed 420 LMAO. Every other character is basic cliche like a \"bad\" step-father who used to be a soldier and now he is strict and says yes sir to almost every person, religious girl who is actually a♥♥♥♥♥♥ few average school bullies, redneck drug dealer, cringy whiteknight who likes movies and of course movies he talks about needs to have some cringy joke or reference let´s go ape (planet of the apes) only even moderately good character Mark Jefferson serial killer who works as a art teacher (who should have butchered the rest of this whole cast).  Friendship lasts forever wohoo main characters have not seen each other on last five years but it takes like few hours to them to go full lesbo, either i don´t know how human relationships work or i just call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and writers don´t seem to understand how long period 5 years is to teenager.  Lip sync and overall animations are at times beyond horrible like this is graphic adventure game which should be based on dialogue and character interaction but then they ♥♥♥♥ up lip sync almost only few things what they should animate compared to other genres since there is not high speed action or anything like that.  Cringeworthy dialogue what feels like 40-50 year olds tried to imitate how teens talk (atleast i hope no one speaks on public like these characters) Hella, Wowsers, Go ♥♥♥♥ your selfie, kool kidz, ready for the mosh pit shaka brah. Even thinking about these makes my backbone shiver.  \"Choices matter\" is something what you usually hear when people are talking about life is cringe whatever choices you make game will end on 2 options either massacre everyone who you have done these \"choices which mattered\" or just rewind the whole game so basically deleting every \"choice that mattered\".... Yeah and also none of the choices really matter on the long run they just effect mostly on the present events like you can prevent suicide if the girl dies she just dies and thats it if she survives she talks to you like once and thats it, most of these choices just do not make really any difference on the main story and why is that only saving Chloe at the start of the game causes this \"super tornado\" but not even single one of these other choices does not cause butterfly effect? Oh yeah bad writing almost forgot.  Game never really explains how time travel works Max just rewinds time when she touches a photograph how did that happen? Oh yeah bad writing almost forgot.  No one seems to care that teenager girl just teleports around of them when she rewinds time but ♥♥♥♥ that.  \"Alternative universe\" so Max touches some photograph and time travels to other timeline or universe i don´t care, in there Chloe and Max are different kind of persons, Max is surprised that some of her school bullies are now her buddies so that should mean that there is another Max on the other timeline but somehow let´s say present Max just takes over other universes Max Consciousness and body if she does 1 question how? Or is there another Max on the alternative universe? That never gets explained oh yeah bad writing almost forgot.  Soundtrack: Hipster music might be fitting for the \"game\" but i personally dislike this kind of music    SUMMARY Wowser how hella bad \"game\" 2/10","hours":14.9,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.5}

It seems like people have established attitudes towards the character you play with no back story as to why they dislike you. Also whats the point of running around with W,A,S,D, when it feels like a point and click adventure. I'd much rather click some one or something and have it run over to them. But instead i'm running over, standing next to someone or something at a specific angle, to then be prompted to click to talk to them anyways. Also whats the point of the dragging the mouse thing when there is literally one thing you can do with that object, and that thing is \"look,\" just let me click the damn object.

{"review":"I really can't understand why this game got good reviews.  (Attention: May contain \"spoilers\")  The characters: One stereotype hunts the other. There is this rebellic punk girl who doesn't like her stepfather. The chearleader that was pregnant from a footballer and had to abort. The girl that gets bullied and wanted to kill herself. And the typical rich ♥♥♥♥♥ who doesn't like you. They tried to put some substance behind the personalities: For example the rich ♥♥♥♥♥ is just so nasty because she's insecure - it was still boring. I really wished they would have had some better authors or psychologists who know more about creating complex characters.  The main character: She is so insecure and shy and has no self-confidence but she is famous for her selfies? WTF? Am I the only one noticing this big logical mistake? And then she calls herself a photo nerd but uses an instant camera? Isn't the substance of real photography knowing how to use all the filters, using different settings with the diaphragm and changing objective lens? My opinion is that the main character was created for little teenager girls so that they can identify with her. But looking behind the facade at least I noticed that the creation is fake, selfish, boring and irritating. Absolutely no chance one can identify with her.  The story: As the character creation is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the story was, too. The dialogues were so long and boring. The story was so predictable. The only scene when I felt something was at the end of episode 3 but actually the idea was stolen from the movie \"Butterfly effect\" with Ashton Kutcher. The first two episodes were unnecessary and could have been comprimed to one episode. Searching for bottles at a scrapyard so that your stupid - oh sorry, I mean \"rebellic\" - friend can shoot on them was absolutey no fun. Also if the game had contained more information about (photography) art itself, the quality would have been much higher.  Conclusion: Boring, predictable and too long for this little content. Maybe nice for young teenagers.   ","hours":15.8,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.25}

{"review":"I'm a big fan of adventure games, and I really, REALLY wanted to like this one. But I'm sorry, I just can't, because Life is Strange was quite possibily one of the most unenjoyable gaming expearinces I have had in a long time. Lets go through everything.    Gameplay: *Laughs uncontrobaly* What gameplay? I understand that this is a story focused game, but that doesn't mean that the actual gameplay sections have to be completly dull, lifeless, and tedious. Almost all of the \"puzzles\" are simply gathering various items, and bringing them back to one location/character. Non of them require ANY amount of actual analytical thinking, which is the kind of thing I expect from this genre. I was hoping that there would be some parts where the time manipulation mechanic could be used in puzzles, and while there are a couple, there are aren't enough to keep anything interesting or add any variety.  Technical: The graphics in Life is Strange are stylized, which is fine, but it begs the question, why? There doesn't seem to be any real need to have graphics stylized. If Max was, say, an illustrator, it would make sense, because then everything looks like a drawing. But she is a photographer, so shouldn't things look realistic then. Honestly I feel the real reason for this was to make it easier to hide some fairly bad textures. While the character models look great, if you look closely at some of the walls, floors, and Frank's hat, it looks pretty fuzzy. The voice acting is extremly solid, espeacially from Ashly Burch, and there was really only one voice actor who left anything to be desired. Unfortunatly, it was the person who mattered the most; Max. She uses the exact same tone of voice throughout the ENTIRE game, no matter what is happening. Also, as a side note, the lip synching in this game is dreadful.   Story: Games like this live and die by their story, and unfortunatly, this game is dead on arrival. Not to say that the concept and ideas in the story are great. The time travel thing was cool, and a quiet town hiding dark secrets gives off a Twin Peaks vibe. Unfortunatly, that is not where most of the plot is focused. Because a majority of the plot is centered around the relationship between Max, and quite possibily the most unlikable personI have ever seen in a work of fiction. For the first three straight episodes, I did not see ONE reason why I should like Chloe Price. She is rude, selfish, and shows very little gratitude for any of the good Max does for her. She did get nicer come episode 4, but it never felt like there was any character development leading to that, it felt more like \"Oh hey, I'm suddenly nice now, and I'm going to apologize for all the♥♥♥♥♥♥I put you through\". However, my biggest problem with her is that despite being an absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ the game insists that I am wrong for disliking her. Everytime I am given a choice of agreeing with her or not (I agreed with her a grand total of one time), the game chastizes me, and says I am wrong for doing so. instead of letting me form my own opinion, the game tells me that this one opinion is right and I am wrong for having the other. ♥♥♥♥. You.  Score: 4/10","hours":11,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.5714285714285714}

{"review":"Life is Strange is poorly animated, has childishly simple and yet still unintuitive controls, and the gameplay is almost nonexistent. And yet, through all these faults I loved the game all the way through the first four chapters.  Unfortunately, the game suffers from the awful Mass Effect 3 Syndrome, in which a game that purports to be about small individual choices comes down to one big choice in the end that completely wipes out any other choices you may have made. In a short game, this is a fatal flaw.  And it's not just the ending - the entire last chapter is a complete departure from the earlier chapters. Chapter 1 and 2 are about high school drama, Chapter 3 and 4 are an investigation into a mystery disappearance. Those are great. Chapter 5 is a psychological/supernatural head trip in which nothing is explained or investigated and must be taken on face value (the opposite of what the other 4 chapters tried to teach you).  This would have been a great game if they'd completely gotten rid of the tornado sub-plot, taken out the nightmare scene at the end, and tied things up neatly with an ending that shows you all the consequences of your other actions, and maybe has some small choices in the beginning turn out to be very important in the end.  I wish I could recommend getting invested in this game, but I felt so betrayed by the final chapter that I cannot.","hours":16.2,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.46153846153846156}

We get nice breakdown of choices at end of each episode and that's it. Major plot points are predefined, specially final ending! And I don't even have issues with this. My main problem is with main mystery left unanswered considering everything in game is caused by it.  Game has its moments and lot of stuff done right. But my greatest disappointment is considering questions asked in this game, and majority of them left unanswered. Very nice mystery imposed, with solid pacing throughout game, but that could be better. Lot of time dedicated to trivial stuff even after, for example 2nd and 3rd episode, where you should start getting some answers!  Big questions about main character are not answered even after complete season! They can not expect to spoon-feed us couple of more filler seasons to get even basic answers.  Good basis for game set, but unfortunately potential is not used very well, or is gated behind seasons to come.

Thankfully they were few and far between, but I couldn't help feeling as though they were a weak attempt to appeal to the masses.  Gameplay mostly consists of looking at boring household items (and listening to the characters description/opinion of them in the aforementioned language style) and rewinding time to accomplish goals like preventing unnamed girl from getting hit by a football. The illogicies of the potential power vs use of power annoy me.  The only praise I have for the game is the soundtrack, which is nice at best.  So yeah, don't pay for episode 1.

I'm not even gonna start on the plot holes. You're better off reading a Sue Grafton novel.  Life is Strange is the interactive equivalent of Twilight, a vapid shell of a \"game\" tacked onto an uninspired story of teenage drama, with an element of supernatural thrown in for... no good reason whatsoever.

{"review":"After all the acclaim this game has received, one would think this would be a good game about time travel, right? No.  Both in gameplay and story it misses all the marks and potential that the genre would give it - and that's precisely why it was so successful. It caters to the lowest common denominator. The story is a trope ridden mess (the setting even mostly revolves around a high school). The characters are trying very hard to be relatable, but only manage to come off as pretentious.  There isn't much gameplay at all - the gameplay loop consists of watching a cut scene - trying to find whichever object or character that is necessary to progress the scene and repeat ad nauseum. Sometimes there are \"puzzles\" - which are usually disgustingly simple with the odd 1 or 2 that have an overly specific solution that make them nearly impossibly hard as a result.  The time rewinding mechanic like the time travel does nothing particularly new or exciting with the concept and thus ends up being nothing more than a pointless gimmick.  This review wouldn't be so scathing if there wasn't a moment or two of brilliance that make me believe that this game could have been so much more than what it ended up as.  The weak gameplay could be overlooked since this is a narrative-focused game - but the narrative is also so weak that the game can't save itself from the mediocrity that comes from watering down an interesting concept to maximize its potential audience.","hours":19,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.4878048780487805}
