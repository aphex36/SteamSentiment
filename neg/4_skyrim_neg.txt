With the creation club and the mod system in SE they diliberately only allow mods they like. Ive tried this on the Xbox One version as well and ironically the xbox has muchlarger of a selection and it sucks just as bad. Vanilla play is good but thats just about it. If your someone who has finishe dthe Skyrim storyline and are looking to add on many more hours of play or just change things up with mods i suggest staying with the original Skyrim on PC if you can find it.
