So when i saw it was on sale, I grabbed it for old times sake. My brother did as well, and we quickly got a online co-op game going.   Things were fine for about an hour, and we got to the first cave where you fight the slimes, and things fell apart. We were completely desynced as far as location, movement, levels, kills, enemies. We might as well have been in completely different games. Which would have been fine, had the screen not been following both of us still. We couldn't progress without telling the other person to run to the right. We struggled on until we killed the bomb-throwing boss, and survived the carriage ride through the woods, but by then we were out of health. I died, and went to the stat screen, and my brother just kept on fighting. I was stuck at that screen and couldn't do anything. Occasionally he would be able to move his cursor and allot skill points, but was unable to exit the screen.  All in all, it was unpleseant, frustrating, and just left us feeling bored and done. The game is still fun, but apparently the online syncing is not great. I'm sure the local play is just fine, but I'll have to try that out later.   TL,DR: This is a very noticably poor PC port of a very fun game.","hours":2.7}

It gets a bit grindy a little ways in, with the difficulty going through the roof at a certain point, until my friends and I had to replay certain levels and play very hit-and-run-style, instead of a natural growth/skill curve.  Also, you can unlock new characters, but each character starts at level 1, meaning you'll get your rear end handed to you unless you're some kind of gaming badass and can take on late-game enemies with a first level character. This terrible leveling/difficulty curve put me off on the game, and no shared XP for unlocked characters I've earned means even more grinding to waste my time. A better learning/leveling curve and some shared XP growth could have gotten me to like the game, but as it is, I only begrudgingly play it a bit every few years if friends pester me to do so.","hours":8.6}

Edit: And of course, no one actually gives a flying ♥♥♥♥ about actual technical♥♥♥♥♥♥   So here's a heads up: There ARE technical issues to the game that play a role in this review outside of subjective preferences.   Here we go.  First off, the technical issues keep me from enjoying this game whatsoever. I've been looking for a new co-op game with a friend for the longest time and it seemed like Castle Crashers, a seemingly esteemed title, would be a flawless experience to try. Unfortunately, multiplayer online gameplay has serious input lag for whatever reason. There are *massive* stutters that occur whenever someone does something. They may be only 50-200 milliseconds long, but it's significant enough that it absolutely ruins the feel of the game.   While I wasn't expecting to encounter any technical hiccups for a game so well received, I'm also not the type of person to not seek for a solution. Suggestions that I've found were stated to render the game at a lower resolution. We knocked it down to the smallest resolution the game supported and the game was still stuttering. Less so than before, but still to an unacceptable degree to play the game. On top of the fact that the resolution was now 640X480. I couldn't even read the controls.  There were literally no other suggestions other than dealing with in game settings. I can online imagine this is because of the engine itself and not the game.   That, is the primary reason I cannot recommend this game. The online support for it is just too shoddy and unstable for me to even recommend. IF someone has another attempted solution (it is NOT the result of a bad connection), I would be glad to hear it. However, my patience has really been tested because now I move onto the subjective part of the review.  The controls and combat don't feel satisfying and instead are exercises of frustration and cramping in my thumbs, and there's an even bigger problem. Maybe it's the stutter. Maybe it's the lag. But the characters have too little width of the attack on the X axis of the game. You literally have to line up your paper thin characters to the paper thin enemies. The worst part? You have 0 mobility when attacking on the ground. Meaning you cannot correct for the utter lack of horizontal range (up and down, which is the \"side to side\" of your character. Again, the X axis of the game). This is mitigated by jump attacks but you still suffer from the \"thinness\" problem.  It's simply unfun to me and feels unsatisfying to play. I could barely make it through an hour or two before my thumbs started to cramp from thumbing the Xbox controller.   That's not to say the other parts of the game aren't good. The humor is there, the artwork is there, and I'm sure it's stupid fun with more people. But the controls just suck for me. And the technical issues with multiplayer make it even worse. I cannot recommend this, and I'm actually pretty disappointed and sad to do so.   The technical problems may vary from person to person, configuration to configuration (and it should be said, my computer far surpasses the technical requirements), but the buyer should be at least weary of these issues.  Maybe the other reviews are nostalgia tinted, maybe they didn't have the technical issues I had. But I don't like the gameplay, and the technical problems don't make it any better.","hours":2.3}
