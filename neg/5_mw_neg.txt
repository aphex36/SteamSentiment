So I decided to purchase the PC version & was very disapointed in the way it runs.   1. It ♥♥♥♥♥es on about Punkbuster, & when launching PB it doesn't have a whitlist option for CoD4. 2. No sound upon opening Multiplayer, no mater what I do, even verifying files or Deleting & reinstalling. 3. Even for a game that was launched in 2007, it's somewhat still damanding for my modern 2 year old laptop. 4. Crashes upon trying to even quit the software, I always have to open Task Manager.

There are only a handful of missions to do and you can get through them very quickly, four hours to be exact. This is one of those games where they thought they could get away with a weak single player experience by having more multiplayer content. Something I hate because one day there won't be multiplayer servers, and all that will be left will be a terrible game overall.  I feel like enemy recognition is poor in this game compared to past CoD's. Also, I've noticed suicidal suad members love to run in front of your shots and the game will make you restart for friendly fire even though it was some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ NPC that wanted to kill himself. Sometimes NPCs will push me out of cover and I have to walk all the way around them while being shot at to get back into cover.   Pros:  Lots of Varied weapons with different attachments  Cons:  Weak story, short single player experience Friendly NPCs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Enemy Recognition not as good as past games  Do you get one Hour of gameplay per $6 paid?: Yes, it meets the bare minimum.
