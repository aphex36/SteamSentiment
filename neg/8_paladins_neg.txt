{"funny_percent":0.1993013551645442,"helpful_percent":0.4322132208714971,"review":"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW It used to be a really unique FPS. Its high TTK (Time to Kill) made every fight and duel very fun and exciting. Champions were different from each other (while usually balanced at the same time). The old card system added lots of customization and variety. Sadly, it went downhill for some time now. Each update dumbed the game down and removed every unique aspect of it (probably trying to mimic another certain hero shooter game): Lowered TTK. Now who shoots first can win any duel (E.g.: 1600 DPS Androxus). Nerfed mobility. (E.g.: RIP dodge roll Cassie) Many champions lost their uniqueness (E.g.: Buck was a tanky flank; Evie's slow projectile speed). Less skillful gameplay in general. Semiautomatic mechanic. (E.g.: Lex and Andro required aim) Pros Nice graphic style and champion design. Good optimization: It used to? can run on most PCs. Decent community. Neutral Low TTK / many one shots. Cons Bad balancing. Many bugs. Bad matchmaking. No outplay possibilities. Generic champions. Huge hitboxes. (After OB64) Grind2Win / Pay2Win. I would have really recommended this game time ago, but now it just isn't fun anymore.","hours":666}

So much stuff has changed, so many balance changes that doesn't make any sense, and then the constant overhaul of game mechanics just for the sake of it. It's sad to say but Hi-Rez has lost their minds. They have no idea what to do with the game other than to try and squeeze as much money out of the players as possible before the game eventually dies.
