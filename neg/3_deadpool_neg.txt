{"review":"Product received for free  I don't recommend this game. Don't get me wrong, the jokes are funny and Deadpool is an incredibly charming character. However, the game does have a few shortcomings. The combat system is a complete joke what with the related keys being all over the place. On top of that, attempting to bind the keys any differently are more likely to lead to frustration, so don't even think about trying to fix it.  This game's movement mechanics do not pair up nicely with the games puzzles either, leading to an incredibly infuriating experience. On a side note, there are several points in the game that take control away from the player, which always breaks the immersion. This, however, may have been an intentional design choice by the developers to poke fun at other games of similar genre and to reference Deadpool's tendency to break the fourth wall. Perhaps this is simply Poe's Law in action, and I'm actually writing a serious review of a satire game for a character built around satire.  I would rate this game a 6 out of 10. The graphics are solid and the game is well optimized, but trying to do anything besides mash buttons is an incredibly frustrating and annoying experience that I would not wish to revisit at any time in the future.  I assume that you, the developers of this game, started the introduction of Deadpool to the mainstream, so I must congratulate you there.  Thank you for your time.","hours":2.5,"funny_percent":0.03278688524590164,"helpful_percent":0.5573770491803278}

{"review":"This game is hilarious and has a wonderful sense of humor. Although it's been years since I've played it, many of the jokes still make me smile. However, the worst thing about this game is its gameplay, and that's kind of a problem for a game, in my opinion. Certain enemies are bullet sponges who just make the game take longer without adding any challenge or fun. I didn't want to have to play the game because I wasn't having fun actually playing it, but I wanted desperately to see all of the cutscenes. Was it worth playing through it to see them? Over all, yes.   However, YouTube exists, and so do videos of the game's plot and jokes, all in order, and it's the source of about 90% or more of the game's entertainment. If you want the publisher and/or developer to have money, I suppose you could either find a way to donate themcash, or buy the game but just watch the cutscenes on Youtube. Actually playing the game just wasn't worth my time and wasn't fun, while the humor was magnificent.","hours":8.6,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.65625}

It tells you to hold U to open and when you do 75% of the time Deadpool tries to open it and fails. You repeat this over and over and eventually the stars align and you open the chest.

Oh - and like almost every other game out there designed for console players (yes - it IS a console game adapted to PC) - you have to unplug any usb joysticks, otherwise the camera just goes around in circles.

The character doesn't die. I would have felt ripped off if I had bought this at full price. I wouldn't recommend this game unless you're really into Deadpool and are bored.  Edit to add. Ok, now I've completed the game. Wow, 8 hours. This is a very basic game, no frills. Very limited destructible environments, repetitive enemies. Healing mechanic is the same as any other game.

{"review":"Just to say, I love Deadpool... The comic anyway. But this game just doesn't do it justice.   To begin with, it doesn't sync with steam cloud. If you have to uninstall for any reason prepare to start from scratch. Not a massive problem considering how short the game is.  Yes the storyline is funny, and the 4th wall breaks are funny, but the gameplay is just plain boring. The naration provided by deadpool through the gameplay gets predictable and drawn out towards the end. I think he has 2-300 lines through the game, which considering his status as 'merc with a mouth', is far too low.  Its your standard spam button melee game, with some upgrades to get combo's. The upgrade system is OK, but doesn't really add much to the game.  The major problem I have with this game is towards the end. the last few levels give up on design altogether, and just become another game that throws countless waves of increasing difficulty opponents whilst you grind away hoping that this will be the last one untill the level is over.  If you haven't got the rb + y or insta-kill upgrades then you will forever be dieing just to gain enough points to finally get the required upgrades. I spent a good 30 min repetativley trying to kill the last boss, which again is nothing but waves of enemys, just so I could upgrade to the last hammer combo (which was my main weapon in the game) and then the boss was trivial. Hitting 2-3 buttons to instakill enemys that were taking 15+ hits to kill before, and would regain health if you had to run to heal.  In short, It's an OK game, but for the franchise it should of been so much better. Hopefully now that the movie has gotten so much attention we can get a decent game that will do deadpool justice.","hours":10.8,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0}

I possibly made the mistake of playing it on the highest difficulty \"ultra-violence\". In this mode nearly every enemy can one-shot you, even if you are fully specced, with every single perk you can buy. That and the way too few autosaves made it a real pain to play through.  Additional to that I found some glitches. There were several unexpected death by projectiles that flew through walls. Sometimes I just died without seeing anything. In the final stages I had only a quater second of time to dodge the oneshot attack, right after a video sequence, which I had to watch over and over again.  And who the hell thought of this keyboard controls?   On the highest difficulty the battles were additionally really long, so the story feels really dragged throughout the game, while it is becoming thinner and thinner to the end.

{"review":"The humour actually could be enough on its own to recommend this game; sadly, the mechanics are often so broken and annoying there's no fun in playing. The ideas are good, and the violence is awesome, even the Arkham style battle WITH blood is on the right track. But when there's so many enemies outside of frame that can suddenly kill you and you die in two blows on the hardest setting, it just becomes annoying. There's more enemies in Devil May Cry, but that's not a problem there, so it shouldn't be a problem here. I'm guessing the game is an ok playthrough on easy setting because it let's you soak in all the fun stuff along the way, but a game has to be rewarding, and playing though on easy isn't rewarding - I could just watch a movie in stead.  I really tried to like the game too, because Deadpool is such a fun character and I love the Arkham and Devil May Cry games. But in my tenth hour of gaming, I had enough: The same button (B) that let's you teleport/evade also blocks. That means that if you decide to evade, but there's a block \"active\" on an enemy, you will automatically block instead of evading. When evading is what you have to do because some superfat enemy is jumping at you, and you block in place instead, you're instakilled. And that's just one of the more annyoing mechanics. Also looting chests often does not work, and when there's a time limit on that, or an enemy close by, that's fatal.  I must say this though, they could actually make a good game, if they tried to play it before they released it and removed all the anooying stuff, so even if I can't recommend this game, I will/would play the sequel if it ever comes.","hours":9.7,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.46153846153846156}
