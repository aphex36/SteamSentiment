The Evil Within is a third-person survival horror video game developed by Tango Gameworks and published by Bethesda Softworks. And it is DISAPPOINTING af! This game makes absolutely no sense. The only things that this game has going for it is its stereotype of a stereotype, yet immensely attractive, of a main character and a really cool antagonist.   The story is clouded and lacking, the graphics are not up-to-par and the game gives you hardly any ammo! Which p!ssed me off while playing. Ruvik (the antagonist) is the best part about this game. He made every minute worth playing, but even he is not enough to make this game even exceptionally good . . . because hes not even seen that much!  Please keep in mind, this is a personal criticism. Metracritic gave this game a 75 and IGN gave it a 8.7/10. So its apparent that professional critics approved well of this game. Put personally, I would not recommend in the slightest.

Survival Horror with RE4 controls, Last of Us item management, with Outlast style hiding and sneaking. However, I just cannot bring myself to give this game a decent review. The controls are clunky at best and every enemy encounter is just frustrating. Enemy attacks take precedence over yours even if you triggered your action way before they did. None of the mechanics seem to work properly. Picking up items, dismantling traps, even aiming your gun seems like a chore. And that's what this game is. A chore. I felt like I should have been getting paid to play this game because it felt like I was at work. All of this could be forgiven mind you, if the story and characters were compelling. Unfortunately this isn't true for either. The characters are dull, cookie cutter anime archetypes but with less depth. The story aims to be an epic psychological adventure, maneuvering through mutilated monsters and unraveling the mysterous story behind a dangerous, telepathic big bad. But I do not care about these people at all. I should have turned and run as soon as I booted it up for the first time and saw the dreaded \"Bethesda\" splash screen but I decided to give it a shot anyway.

The game might be good -- I didn't get a chance to see -- but don't buy it on Steam and try to play it on your PC.  Since this game is a shooter, I tried to play it with my keyboard and mouse.  Right away, the menu was awful, with horrible floaty mouse acceleration. But the keybinding screen was its own special hell. Once you've selected a function to bind, there's no way to back out: any keypress or mouse click is registered as an attempt to bind the function. But, you have to click in the list of functions in order to focus it so you can scroll down to see all of the functions... which selects whatever function you clicked on, and forces you to bind it. You can't unbind the keys, either, because hitting Backspace or Delete tries to bind that key... so I ended up with multiple keys bound to every function as I desperately tried to navigate this nightmare of a menu. Also, this game commits the cardinal sin of displaying a popup when you try to bind a key that's already bound, and asking you to confirm the rebind... Every. Single. Time.  If you've got a modern mouse, you can't even bind the thumb mouse buttons or the scroll wheel.  Scrolling in in-game notes is broken. All the notes are cut off, and there's no way to scroll down and read them with the mouse and keyboard, so you miss huge chunks of the story.  So I picked up the controller, since the game was forcing me to, and there's no option to invert the camera X-axis. You can invert the Y, but not the X.  That's the point at which I quit and refunded this awful port.","hours":0.6}

The story is really interesting, but almost impossible to fully understand, which isn't a bold move by the director, but bad storytelling. The dialogue is really cheesy, and the main protagonist is extremely bland, he barely says anything. The scary aspect of the game is really well done though, I felt tense and on edge during my whole playthrough, especially if you play with headphones.

That's about all the good stuff you can say about this game. The gamemechanics is probably one of the worst I have experienced in any game so far. There is no way to focus on your enemy, so once you performed a melee attacke your character stumbles forward and it's easwy to loose your enemy out of sight. So you have make a turn around to satisfy the animation, until you can do the next attack. Ammo is horrible low, which is probably ok for a survival game, if it were not for the fact that you have situations where you can not sneak by. So you die a lot because of the clunky character movement combined wih the low amount of ammo. Another issue, that really annoys me is, that the camera is so close to the character that most of the time you can see only it's back, instead of whats in front of you.

Some of the enemy design was okay, but the humanoid ones were not. The \"safe head\" battles seemed like a blatant ripoff. Bolts glitched right through enemies. Enemies spotted me around corners despite being in the dark and crouched. Some enemies gave off the impression of being boss fights but were actually invincible and it wasn't obvious.

But it wont be fine if this semi cutscene is triggered during a horde of encounters.

Each part it tries to build could if further focused on could make an excellent but it parts fail to come together and cause the game to feel schizophrenic.  The gun play is a standard 3rd person over the shoulder shooter. It works exceptionally well as it also takes into account where you have shot the enemies it can give some nice feedback when shooting in the head or legs. A running motif as well in the game is fire and is constantly a weak point for enemies. There is also some minimum stealth in the game but it is poorly fleshed out and basic and due to a large amount of the game based around ambushes and long corridors. It also makes use of limited ammunition making you play cautious with your weapons especially your larger weapons.  The enemies are a mixture of interesting and generic enemies. The more interesting enemies include the double headed enemies, a slug monster and the keeper enemies which were promptly part of the advertising for the game. Unfortunately most of the enemies are based on some dull zombie like hate enemies and the monster your most likely to fight.  While alot of the gameplay is good and handles itself well the thing that really holds this game back is the story, themes and the level design. First of all the levels are usually set up in either simple arenas to fight off hordes of enemies or in long corridors where your chase by things. This is rather boring but it does sometimes have glimmers of great level design with multiple ways of tackling the area (chapter 3 and the mansion are good examples for me).  The story and themes are the most obnoxious thing about this game. First the game cannot pick any theme for this game so it ends up throwing in all the generic spooky places which you can go to (mental hospital, damned village, creepy mansion, etc) and sends you there for no rime or reason by basically throwing you into the new location. It later tries to explain why this happens but it was so poorly communicated throughout the start of the game that it comes off as a weak excuses for why it is doing it. In fact alot of things which take place happen randomly and really are only explained in side collectibles which should be used to enrich a games story not tell it.  Ultimately The evil Within tries to be too many things at once and it hurts the game alot. If it chose a theme and stuck with it then it would of been a much better if generic horror game.","hours":17.4}

The stealth and action aspect is enjoyable. After two play-throughs I finally somewhat understand the convoluted storyline. Which, by the way, has so many plot holes it may as well be made of swiss cheese.   Overall, I don't recommend the game because of the hours it wastes with frustrating scripted events and forced hiding to progress in specific areas. If I wanted to be a scared little man hiding in a closet I'd stop playing video games and live my life, amirite? I suppose you could say \"well it's not that kind of game!\" Well, it's not a hide-and-seek game either, now is it? It's a bit of mixed bag in that respect, and that's my issue with it. It tries to be too many things, and it makes the parts I like less enjoyable. Either it's action horror or just horror hide-n-seek. Can't we keep it simple and not force the two together?   Well, I suppose that's a matter of personal preference. I'm sure some people love hiding in musty dark corners for hours at a time to avoid being one-shot killed by enemies. Some people like to go fishing and bird watching too, and I'm probably not patient enough to be any of those people. Unless the fishing involves dynamite, then that sounds like fun! These horror stealth events aren't fun, let me stress that, they're annoying and they happen way too damn often.   Which brings me to my next point, what I do recommend about the game. The executioner DLC where you get to wreak stuff, IN THE FACE, with a giant hammer! :D Now that's proper horror action I can get behind. Nice relaxing gore fest of brutal melee with some cool unlockable weapons. Yeah, that was an excellent DLC.   Conversely, the Assignment and the Consequence are both WORSE than the original game. The DLCs come with 90% more hiding and running from scripted death. -_- WORST! DLC! EVER! *Simpsons comic shop owner voice* Yeah, don't even bother buying that garbage just watch the playthroughs for the items and stuff.

I hope to provide an easy-to-understand interpretation of why so many people can't stand it, and so many people give it 5 stars.  The visuals are probably the best part of the game. There is a classic japanese horror game style to the aesthetic. Fans will immediately be reminded of franchises such as Silent Hill or Resident Evil. This world is gritty, grimy, strange, and ruined. There are some parts where they managed to make the environments look really impressive graphically. That said, there are a lot more parts where the graphical quality of the world is just dated. Many portions of the world feel like you weren't supposed to be looking at them; they're blocky and low-quality, and would only look good from a distance. It's also worth mentioning that, although the monsters are interesting at first, you're pretty much only going to see the same handful of zombie-esque enemies throughout the entirety of the game. The appeal wears off after the first few chapters.  The gameplay is atrocious. I attempted to play using M&KB and an Xbox One controller, and neither felt any better than the other. Possibly by design, your character feels clunky and sluggish when he moves, and aiming is downright frustrating, as you'll find yourself wasting several seconds to line up a headshot only to miss and waste precious ammo before the enemy latches onto you and takes out a quarter of your healthbar. There are also stealth sequences in the game, which are almost more trouble than they're worth, as the controls make these sequences painfully slow. If you mess up at all, you're either going to waste the handful of bullets you've managed to save, or you're going to die and have to go back to the beginning, which usually feels like a massive jump since the time between checkpoints in these sections is an eternity. They also have included several \"boss\" sequences that involve running in circles through a maze trying to escape an unkillable monster with bad AI that will kill you immediately if it touches you.  The story is alright. It's not stereotypical or overly cliched. Unfortunately, it's not extremely memorable, and definitely isn't good enough to counter-balance the thoroughly unenjoyable gameplay.   My opinion of the game improved when they added the option to remove the letterboxing, but I sadly discovered that, contrary to my initial belief, the original mind-boggling decision to have black bars take up two thirds of what could be your field of view was not the least enjoyable thing about the game.  If you have extra free time, extra money, and are looking to expand your collection of horror games, you might as well buy The Evil Within. It's not the worst horror game I've ever played, and there are some parts that are worth experiencing. However, I'd recommend you play on easy to reduce frustration, and set your expectations accordingly to the experience you're going to have. To be perfectly honest, the only reason I'm continuing to play it is because I want to finish it purely for the sake of finishing a game I paid for. I don't have any expectation that the final two or three chapters will be an enjoyable gameplay experience, and I don't expect the rest of the story to wow me. Unless you've got a lot of extra cash and just want to experience this game for yourself, I don't recommend bothering with it. Youtube Let's Plays exist for this type of game.","hours":14.2}

The best part of The Evil Within was the first three or four hours. The longer it drags on, the more the plot dissolves around itself. My biggest complaint is that the one's who have played this one are going to be turned off toward the second. I was more frightend in the first hour and a half while playing the sequal than the entirety of The Evil Within.  The beginning of this game starts off pretty well. I enjoyed the idea of exploring the insane asylum, but you immidediately taken away from this place and through a rediculous car transition, you are dropped off in a forest.   \"OK then,\" I thought, \"This doesn't bode well.\" The car transistion left a bad taste in my mouth and I hoped that it didn't forshadow the rest of the game. It did. One more good point to remember before I rip into this game: The game developers give a good since of dread in the save room. It doesn't feel safe and I didn't trust the nurse. Unfortuanaetly, those are the most tense moments in the game.  When I play Resident Evil or Dead Space, two far superior games, I accept that I'm fighting weird, squishy, mutated humanoids. Parasites and aliens go well with these adjectives, but when you are making a horror game about the fear of your own psyche that doesn't work. When I think of my fear of spiders, lots of different things come to mind. How many eyes they have, the dripping ooze that coats their fangs right before they make a kill and how sneakily devious they go about it. Just from those few descriptions I can think of so many badass boss battles that could be made.   I bring this up because there are three main bosses that could have been combined into one and they are (In order of apperance) \"The Creepy Long-Haired Grudge Look-a-Like Girl That Has Many Arms,\" \"The Gigantic Fat Spider Man That Chases You Down While You Flee In A Bus,\" and lastly, \"The Green Tentacle Sewer Monster That Can Camoflauge.\"   My boss would be, \"The Creepy Gigantic Spider That Can Camoflauge.\" It's simple and yet effective. Add other things like long spindily legs and a weakness to fire (triats from the first boss) and the ability to spawn disgusting little minions (traits from the second and third) and WHAM! You got yourself a nice clean boss fight.  The middle feels like filler in what could be a decent show. Characters are bland are the writing is generic. The overall story is interesting (combining multiple human minds and having the protagonist deal with the individual fears) but executed poorly. The game never tells you who's fear is who's are you never deal with the main character's fears. You fight against monsters that are created by the main villian to stop you from doing...something. The \"Grudge Look-a-Like Girl\" is supposed to be the main villian's sister. I personally don't think that makes sense because the villian was sad when she passed and they seemed to have a nice, loving relationship so why would he create a monster out of his dead sisters memory to fight?  The whole thing is conviluded and really doesn't make sense even if you read the collectables. The game becomes hilariously easy at the end even on the hardest difficultly you can play on the first time around which I'm pretty sure is normal. During the ending dialogue, the main protagonist mentions his partner (Jacob? I couldn't tell you) is dead. The player never witnesses this! So how would he know?  The walk to the final boss is just painful. There is literally five minutes of walking, then an arena where you kill thrity regular dudes, followed by a short shooting gallery moment. Then the ending, confusing dialogue, then the final boss that breaks down into quick time events. I forgot to mention that the intro music is garbage comparable to the ending credits song. I didn't listen to it for more than thirty seconds before I skipped it.   It has a New Game+ mode but...no. Just...no. There is probably four hours of enjoyable content. That does not make up for the other eight hours of pain.  5/10  If you lasted this long I would like to thank you for reading this review. My first of many. The link that I posted will lead you to a song that is relative to how I feel about the game. So much wasted potential. At the moment of writing this, I have not played The Evil Within 2 but I have a feeling...no. Don't want to jinx myself. Anyway, thank you and goodnight.

An unoriginal and predictable story. (Edited to make it clear why i dislike and do not recommend it)   Uninteresting characters and generic \"zombie-esque\" enemies (Like quite a few people have mentioned, very RE4-like in many aspects).  Frustrating camera choice and sub-par sneak system. (Poor design choices, not saying the controls are in any way unresponsive)  Dying is frequent and quite a few conventional enemies can 1-2 shot you, let alone the bosses.

Based on my personal experience, background and personality I disliked it for the aformentioned reasons and therefore do not recommend it. This is not meant to say a game is bad or good for everyone, so if you don`t have an issue with it, then enjoy!

The horror is boring and unsurprising, the over-the-shoulder design wastes half the screen, and death is arbitrary and frequent.

Он изо всех сил старается подражать своим старшим и куда более смышленым родственникам. \"Смотри. я нафтояфий псифологичефский хоррор, а еще я хорофий экшен\" - говорит он, пуская пузыри из слюны и рисуя фломастером на обоях.  Конечно, солнышко, конечно.  Хоррор часть - это чистой воды Сайлент Хилл, который вдруг разучился в в сюр, хоррор и вменяемый сюжет. Местный \"хоррор\" и \"сюр\" - это коллекция абсолютно избитых клише, которые просто прут друг за другом без всякого смысла и тематической связи. Сюжет - это зубодробительнейшая солянка тупейших дыр, плоских героев, очевидных поворотов и невыстреливших ружей.  Экшн часть - это Resident evil 4 (С щепоткой TLOU в виде стелза), который совсем, ПРЯМО ВОТ СОВСЕМ разучился в экшн. Потому что грош цена экшену, в котором настолько кривая анимация героя, спринт в три секунды и настолько убогие левелдизайн и боссфайты. Интересных и необычных боевых ситуаций за всю игру фактически ноль, зато раздражающих дофига и больше, с принципом \"а давайте каждая вторая фигня будет нашего героя тупо ваншотить, лол\". Елинственное, что радовало всю дорогу - красиво разлетающиеся от хэдшотов мозги. На этом пожалуй все. Как подобное позорище получилось у автора вышеупомянутого RE4 (который один из самых разнообразных и механически доставляющих экшенов в истории) - загадка веков. Видимо в игрострое знаменитое имя реально значит куда меньше, чем стоящая за ним команда.  В общем, все печально. \"Триумфальное возвращение\" бати в жанр на деле оказалось куда слабее даже посредственного Resident Evil 6. С упомянутым выше золотым пантеоном сабж даже в одном предложении называть как-то неловко.  Впрочем, совсем уж злиться на игру тоже не получается. Со временем ее неловкие каракули начинают-таки доставлять свое особенное удовольствие. Знаете, сродни удовольствию от просмотра компиляции фейлов на ютубе. До конца игру я проходил с настроением \"ну-ка посмотрим как ты испортишь все в этот раз, любопытно же\".Так оно работает куда лучше.  Ну и еще она периодически очень красива в статике. Читай - на скриншотах.  Тоже достижение.","hours":18.5}
{"funny_percent":0.2516989374931791,"helpful_percent":0.3016265224430652,"review":"I would not normally write a review so long after the release of a game, but with the sequel recently released I thought some people might want to know how the original holds up several years later. The answer really depends on what you are looking for. The Evil Within is not scary. There are no real jump scares, and the story is so nonsensical and the characters so nondescript that the psychological horror just doesn't work. The things you see and do in this game are insane, but so are the things you see and do in Super Mario Bros. Simply put, this is not a survival horror game as there is no horror aspect.  So what if you are here for the tense resource management survival gameplay that Mikami popularized with the first Resident Evil? Well you'll likely enjoy the first half of this game. The first third takes place in a rural village filled with possessed \"zombies\", not unlike Resident Evil 4. And like in that game you spend a significant amount of time roaming about the environment looking for health restoratives, ammo, and weapons. The Evil Within adds a stealth mechanic to the RE4 formula which gives you are third option in addition to shooting everything that moves and running away.   These early levels largely move at your own pace, and reward careful exploration and a mastery of the mechanics. If the game ended after chapter 4 or 5 I would likely have no trouble recommending this game to anyone looking for some more RE4. But there are another 2/3 of the game to go after this intro segment and each chapter gets progressively worse. By the final levels, gameplay has devolved into running through a series of linear corridors from one-hit-kill monsters who you have no hope of hiding from or killing. This is interspersed with segments that have you trying to navigate through a series of death traps that are also filled with one hit kills, many of which are almost impossible to avoid your first time through.   These final five or so levels are so frustrating and incompetently designed that it is a wonder they were made by the same designers. Meanwhile, the art direction which starts out fairly moody and atmospheric eventually just leans into the whole random things floating through the void look that just feels lazy. Exploration is not only no longer encouraged, it is often impossible due to the ultra linear nature of the level design, and/or the fact that one wrong step leads to an instant death.   Meanwhile the middle third is merely average. It includes sequences in a hospital, a run down mansion, and other horror movie tropes connected by no real narrative tissue. The mansion level specifically is a decent little puzzle in and of itself, but it has almost no connection to anything else that occurs in the game.   So the concluding third of the game is borderline unplayable, the story is barely present and the game isn't scary. All that seems fairly negative, but I will say that I think players who enjoyed RE4 will likely find a lot to like with the first 2/3 of the game. A more robust upgrading system gives you more and more options as the game progresses and lets you tailor the game to your preferred playing style. Overall, were this a traditional gaming website I would likely score The Evil Within a 5 or 6 out of 10. Not horrible by any means but certainly not great.  As a final note, I played the game on a system using a Geforce 1080, Intel Core i7 6700k, 16 GB of DDR4 RAM, and a PCIe connected SSD. I had no issue on that system with running the game at max settings in 1080p. Your mileage may vary, and The Evil Within is certainly not a good enough looking game that it warrants the degree of technical issues many users experience. So while I can't say whether all of the game's technical issues have been entirely fixed, I can say that I didn't experience anything outside of some rather poor framepacing that occasionally made the game seem like it was juddering. This issue was fairly minor though, and other than that the game performed fine on my machine.","hours":15.9}

Just as if devs had some sort of list of things that worked \\ scared us succesfully in other games \\ movies \\ books, checked every point of it and bashed them all with a devhammer until it was one piece and poured it with plot-sauce to fill the gaps. But the \"sauce\" is thin and bad. Clearly guys who made this game had no idea what they want to achieve, what story they want to tell. Until half of the game you are given almost none clues on what is happening, those you got turns in some part completly irrelevant to the story. Then, halfway till the end BAH! and all is served to you in one go. But by then you will figrue out WTF (in general as some story gaps and inconsitencies are impossible to explain even today and you are free to choose friom several fan theories out there) if you followed recent horror trends.

I'll start with the positives. The graphics were decent for 2014 and the game ran smooth enough. Weapon variety is decent as is the variety of enemies. Bosses were challenging, although the spider lady was a bit cheap. Voice acting was decent for a RE type game.   Now the stuff that turned me off. The camera is crap and the game is letterboxed so sometimes you need to see something above your head and that makes it hard to see what's going on. Tank controls don't lend themselves to puzzles where you have to precisely control your character. Twice I had bosses glitch and remain frozen, they wouldn't kill me when I fed myself to them. This killed emersion something fierce.   I would have liked the game a lot better if there was an option to not have to do the final puzzle with Ruvik's \"eye\".
