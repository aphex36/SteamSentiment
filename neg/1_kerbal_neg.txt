The career mode has a max of two missions. Missions that are sometimes vague. Some missions that really need a tutorial. Some missions are actually misleading (intentionally?). Then you build your ship. The interface is very terrible and you spend half of your ship building time adjusting the camera. If you have any OCD at all the rocket fins will make you quit the game right there. Later you find out you can't even build complicated rockets. There is a 30 part limit. Once you deal with all the frustration you get to finally launching the rocket. Now if anything goes wrong during these flights at all. There is no help. You have to repeat the annoying launch sequence over and over until you find out what went wrong. Mostly half the time it's the parts not having some vague parameter set correctly. No help on that, sorry. Also mostly half of the time it's the insanely frustrating controls. The other small percentage is the \"yeah your game might be bad so move your save files and reinstall everything.\" I never ran into the last one, but when it kept coming up on search results in forums i knew this probably wasn't the game for me ... or anyone.

Poor graphics its about 900 mb in size, its like one of those cheap 2d games with some crapy 3D polygon looking graphics from the late 80s. Its probably got some ok gameplay once you get past a ton of reading material thats boring as batcrap to go through while learning how to put together a rocket. Theres so many of these type games flooding the market i just can't justify paying over 35 dollars AU for this when you can buy games that are far superior in graphics and gameplay. If i see this title for 5 dollars in the future i'll add it too my collection, till that point in time i think there are better games on the market for the price these developers are asking for.

Engines sit at about 1% thrust and normal thrust controls do not work, and yes i checked before launch that they were set at 100% and had both fuel and oxidizer in the tanks.

Note that if you do qualify for a transfer and choose to do it, the process is OPTIONAL and IRREVERSIBLE.

When designing a plane, it is essential to know the center of mass, thursust vector, center of lift. But these default off everytime the design screen is accessed and it takes 3 clicks to turn them on. To make a functioning plane, a ton of other information is needed too, but is simply hidden. And a lot of the options for customization are totally hidden, discoverable only by random right clicking.   In flight, there is simply no way to get all the information you need one screen - or even on multiple screens. You need to constantly switch back and forth between craft and map views... *and* you need to do complex interactions with the UI to get the data you need. You magically need to know when to left or right click. The map view inexplicably starts at a 90 degree angle, when you almost always will need a top down view of the polar region. You can't trigger a rocket stage from the map view, which makes launching unecessarily hard and a stream of panicked switching between map and craft view.  And on and on and on. So. Many. Papercuts.  The UI might have been exusable when the game first launched. But it has been selling strongly for years and is under active development. FIX IT.","hours":120.7}

Also Steam reviews were really good. Never again.  First thing what struck me is that the game presents itself like a person with severe speech disorder. You need a mediator to understand what it asks from you. Practically for every mission, even simplest ones, you going to need to Google. Because stuff is a lot, it's complex and nothing is explained.  Tutorials cover some basics but that's completely different stuff.  For example - first missions are about observation of certain site from correct altitude. All quest conditions are met - nothing happens. I had to Google to find some good fella on Youtube who has explained that I simply need to click on landing pod and press button \"Report\" in the context menu...   Second - gameplay is undbearably boring and repetitive. The term is \"grind\". Yeah, some of the stuff is pretty complex and when you do it for the first time it's kinda exciting. First ballistic hit, first orbital launch, first Moon slingshot.  But when you do it 30th time... 60th time? Opening first node in tech tree requires like several missions. Second tier - about 10. Third - about 30. And due to tech limitations they gonna be identical. Launch, correct trajectory, land. Nothing changes around and nothing to look at...  I don't usually complain about lack of an eyecandies in games but... Moon? Yeah, you jump higher, but it's just empty surface with pixels of different color. Have you seen Macdoodle's Galacticraft Moon? Way better, though it's just Minecraft blocks.  Also two pence about \"realism\". Why do you even need complex kinetics and gravitational interactions if you defy simple logic.  First. Your \"space program\" is all reversed. First - unmanned remotely controlled flights and only then piloted ones.  Second. ICBR can hit spot with 2 meters precision on the other side of the Earth. But to do that trajectory and thrust are calculated and plotted long before rocket reaches launchpad. In KSP I can't even see where I need to go before I adrift about 30 km above Kerbin. Term \"flight simulation\" rings a bell?  Third. Rocket on the launchpad stands on its nozzles. That's... really off. And then falls and explodes? Is that what comes for humor in this game?  TLDR. If you like games like farm simulators, where you, IRL year after IRL year, do the same stuff. If you like to play LEGO. If you've got patience to build a ship model from matches or a casle from cards, this game could please you. Otherwise - waste of time and money.","hours":35.9}

Because I really like the origin one as it refered to a very famous poem, I checked what had happened, and found this ↓, which is the begin of the conflict. https://steamcommunity.com/app/220200/discussions/0/2592234299528870465/ Here, the OP translates the \"不到Mun非好汉\" into \"without reaching Mun you are not a good male\", but if you copy this sentence into google, it will give \"Less than the Great Wall is not a hero\", here \"Less than\" should be translated into \"Without reaching\", and the \"好汉\" is translated into \"hero\" instead of \"good male\".  So as a conclusion, this is someone that neither good at Chinese nor English, and have zero concept about Chinese culture. Actually as a Chinese I feel shame about him/her. If \"不到Mun非好汉\" can be a symbol of sexism, then this game itself is a sexism game. Why all the little greens have the last name Kerman instead of Kerwoman? Why we build long rockets with fairing and two side boosters? Why the planets look like eggs? Why there is no female restroom inside the game? I mean, uh, there is something you should take serious and something not, and it is better to understand what we are thinking before post it to everyone. Also, intentional rumors and prejudice is the worst thing I could ever imagine in a game forum like KSP. Grandstanding is not a good idea to attract people and I think everyone does not appreciate afterwards apology for rumors, prejudice and grandstanding. And for those who say they DO NOT CARE, if you really do not care, I hope you do not make comments on this kind of issue. The only problem here I concern is that why someone post a topic and say something then a worse plan can be applied, and even if there are so many people refuse this, the developers still have not show any intention of changing it. That is just not fair. For those who say Chinese people do not own the game, but we have the right to say whether WE think this game is good or bad. So WE have the right to put negative reviews on the translation problem. Also for those who think we RAID the reviews and once the forum, part of the reason is that we feel that we are being insulted. What will you think if the name of KSP becomes Kerbal Man Restricted Space Program or some worse names JUST because one single topic? Otherwise, there are plenty of offensive topics and replies with racism and bias. So, that's what I want to say. I mean, if the developers can see such comments, that are the sources of the recent negative comments. And there is a function called edit review.","hours":43.2}
