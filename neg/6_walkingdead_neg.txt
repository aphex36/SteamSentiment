If this is the future of narrative and point and click adventure games i don't like it.  The good things: - The story and characters are great - The voice acting is very good - The relationship building of the characters is also very well executed  The bad things: - Just as \"life is strange\" this games suffers from the illusion of choice given to the player, they sell you that your actions change the plot but they really doesn't, you get the same results no matter what you do, sure some things change but they are minimal, like lines of dialogue or a character surviving for one more episode and then it dies anyway you chose to help him/her or not. - The DLC is ridiculously short (~1hour) and doesn't add anything to the main story. - Quick Time Events - Puzzles for stupid people, like for real, the puzzles are so easy, i don't think i failed once in my first run, you don't even have to think, you have an objective, and you have three objects well highlighted to interact with, use your 4 brain cells to use the objects and you are done.","hours":20}

The game is very much linear, making choice an illusion and effort spent on those decisions wasted.
