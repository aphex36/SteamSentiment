{"review":"I'm fairly well versed in Roguelikes, and while RoR is certainly difficult, the game isn't so much about skill as it's about getting extremely lucky. The best strategy I've found involves sprinting through each level to the teleporter and cheesing the following fight as hard as you can to win. This leads to the unfulfilling gameplay loop of \"Did I get anything good, did I get close teleporters to the spawns, and did I get easy bosses in the first 2 stages? If not, you're going to get 1 shot by something on the third level, restart.\"  I tried setting it down to Drizzle (easy) and the game became TOO easy. While I was now able to fight things and buy everything I wanted, there's no interesting item combinations since you eventually collect everything, and none of them interact in interesting ways. Combined with the fact that each level only has 1-2 variations, you'll see everything this game has to offer in about 2-3 playthroughs.  I like the graphics and the music, but the gameplay's just not fun.","hours":15.4,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.4166666666666667}

Then I stop playing for a year, then wonder why I stopped playing. Try again, and just don't have fun. I think it's a fine gameplay mode for some. And I enjoy hard games. But the tempo of excalation is one that makes me not enjoy this game. I've made my way though some crazy hard games. But I get pleasure out of taking my time and exploring while I do. You will get punished to the point of not feeling like you are getting anywhere if you share what I enjoy about games like these. If you we don't share that in common, you may enjoy this game.

{"review":"Recently tried replaying this game in hopes that I may actually like the game. Unfortunately it made my thoughts on the game even more justified. The difficulty in single player is almost absurb, with a large skill gap between easy mode and the next difficulty (seriously, I got about 4 levels of no enemies spawning, even sometimes during the teleporter waiting phases on easy, and then was completely overwhelmed within minutes on the next difficulty). The game is a bit better with friends as long as its stable, but that only lasts until you learn that there is a chance your save file may become corrupt, meaning your unable to save and stuck in a new game state. I've tried the many suggestions given to me through looking up help on this bug, but unfortunately nothing had worked.  I know my experiences aren't the same compared to others, but while i was almost starting to enjoy the game, the corrupt save bug completely ruined any chance that I and any others who encountered this same problem would ever end up liking this game. Its been a very rocky and buggy adventure, but atlas I think I may just call it quits with this game.","hours":9.9,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.25}

{"review":"It is with heavy heart that I cannot recommend this game.  I do like Risk of Rain, as should be obvious by how much I've played it. It does have some curious balance decisions that are a bit frustrating, but ultimately forgivable.  What's not forgivable are the bugs. I am on Linux and about one in every four games I play ends in a crash. I have scoured the internet, tried dozens of fixes, and I still get errors about missing Game Objects. This happens across two different computers running Ubuntu, and even on my windows machine the game has crashed on me a few times. The final straw is the fact that I cannot even unlock the miner because the game crashes every time the boss to unlock him spawns.  A few small things that would at least help mitigate the worst of the trouble would be making cloud saving a thing, and also making it so when you unlock something the unlock is instantly recorded into your save file, not at the end of the run. I don't know if this would be enough to make me want to play again but it would be a major step in the right direction.  It's too bad because without the bugs this would be an easy recommend, the art is great, the soundtrack is good, gameplay is overall dynamic and interesting, but with this many game breaking bugs I can't even enjoy it anymore.","hours":48.7,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.3076923076923077}
{"review":"This game doesn't do much in terms of co-op. Being precise enough - it absolutely doesn't do anything. All I can call it, is a pity of a PC port, I totally don't recommend it for co-op.  Having played quite a few minutes in the singleplayer (after many simple tries to play co-op with my friend) I found it has quite an ok for the genre gameplay. I rarely write reviews for games because I find it boring but when the game has such a HUGE minus I can't be silent, I hope people don't waste money on it and it's probably better to buy it on a console (or download a free .torrent on PC with some software to play co-op Kappa). I really can't rate it.  Just judging by coop I give it 10 connection failed out of 10 connection failed pop ups.","hours":0.5,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0}
{"review":"If you are buying this to play on Windows and you are into this kind of game, all the positive reviews by others stand. There are bugs, but you can generally go around them with some Googling.  Sadly, if you plan to play on Linux like I did, you should absolutely not buy it in its current state. At first it looks exactly the same as on Windows, but it has two verified game-breaking bugs that will ruin everything for you. Both of them freeze the game and lose you any progress you made in that run (and with runs sometimes taking way over an hour, you will certainly feel the sting).  Currently there is no solution or workaround for either bug, and the game seems to be abandoned by its developer, so there is no fix incoming. In its current state, I cannot recommend this game on Linux.","hours":197.7,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.7777777777777778}
{"review":"I played this game at launch and recently got back into it. The game looks fantastic and the soundtrack is stellar.  The problem, however, is that the game is ludicrously unbalanced in almost every aspect of combat. The only way to survive here is to be constantly running away from enemies and turn around to fire one shot at them, then run away again. This is boring as♥♥♥♥♥♥and most enemies can even run as fast as you can, meaning there isn't a single point where you can reliably get a hit on enemies. Melee characters are objectively worse than ranged ones because of this.  Having infintely respawning enemies once you activate the boss is one of the worst design decisions I've ever seen. You're told to run away until time runs out, but there's two problems with this. One, it means you have to constantly dodge the boss for 90 seconds while ensuring you get no progress since enemies respawn infinitely and there's no opportunity to attack the boss. This is a pointless time waste as far as I'm concerned. Two, once the smoke clears and the boss is dead, the remaining enemies are sometimes clumped into a swarm on one platform. I legitimately don't understand what the developers expect you to do in that situation. If you're a melee character, you have to restart. If you have a ranged attack, you literally either have to jump onto the platform, fire once, and jump out lest you get overrun immediately, or you have to exploit the enemies' inability to move from the platform and just shoot from safety. This doesn't work on later stages, though, since you'll have an absurd amount of enemies that can teleport and fly while you're stuck running away forever until you die from getting hit from nowhere.  The only way to get past this is by getting lucky on some trinket spawns. Some of these make you so overpowered that the game turns into \"quit when you get bored\" instead of the normal \"quit because you can't even attack things\".  I really want this game to be good, but I can't in good conscience recommend this. It's so bad it's like they didn't even play test it.","hours":21.9,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0}

What I can't tolerate is the fact that the game crashes. A lot. In different computers. Even after reinstalling the game. I've read about this bugs since 2014, I've suffered in 2015 and now, in 2017, it still crashes.  I bought a 4-pack and some friends were able to play it with relatively no problem (controller configs, hosting games, etc), so I never even tried to ask for a refund.
