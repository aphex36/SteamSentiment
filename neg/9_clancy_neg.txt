Enemies are largely the same, except for their levels. Hit a wall of enemies too difficult to handle? Casually walk back through the streets to scoop up a few extra missions so you can come back and fight the exact same enemies you have been fighting, but with higher numbers.  There is nothing here that causes you to feel like you NEED to do anything differently. Sure they might have grenades to move you from cover, but you have a limitless healing box. The environment is almost NEVER an issue, presumably because sub zero temperatures mean nothing when you have a parka and a scarf. Oh, and that irradiated building? Well, as long as you have the right level(?) of gas mask you'll be fine. There's no sense of urgency whatsoever.

I really feel if this game was more on the tactical side and was linear it could have been a dang darn good game. I get a tactical feel for many reasons. One obvious reason is that it was co-developed by Red Storm. It definitly has that Ghost Recon/Rainbow Six HUD going on and I liked that alot. It was cool to see amount of space in the characters bag and amount of aid items I had all without having to switch between gameplay and going to an inventory menu. Probably one of the most comfortably designed HUDs for a third person game. The other bit of what makes this game tactical is the cover system. I enjoyed that once I was in cover I was capable of moving to other places in the enviroment for cover that were highlighted by holding down the cover button. The really distressed looking urban atmosphere though is what really got my chub going. What didn't get my chub going was the story. The whole sleeper agent idea that made up The Division just did not feel plausible at all. I just wanted to skip every scene I was forced to watch. I saw somebody die before I got on a helicopter, right? That happened didn't it? I don't really know who it was, didn't care though. What killed the chub most of all was the RPG system. Never have I cared sssooooo little in a game that had skill system. I didn't feel compelled at all to look what skills were available, nor spending any points I had available. It just didn't seem like it mattered. Though it probably matters later in the game as this is a level based game. I only got excited when I finally got a rifle with a scope. The idea of having a loot-based RPG that is also trying to be tactical just doesn't go well together. At best they make strange bedfellows. In short, this game had potential. Rather than looking to games like Borderland, Diablo, WoW or for that matter any always online MMO RPG where you find random generated weapons and gear that give perks it really should have looked to a game like S.T.A.L.K.E.R.; a game that plays tactically with minor RPG mechanics that has weapons and armor you get excited to find.  6.85 out of 15","hours":3}

I spent more time downloaing game, downloading their luncher, and even watchng their pregrame clips then actual play time. I would think I never got out of tutoral ad it was exploring the Brooklyn map. So based of the little game play I got here is my review.  Game is lacking and chunky controls. Too hard to kill enemies, expect to die alot. Navigating around menu's is painful. And the game really isnt very insightful on what to do in the first mission of exploring Brooklyn. Whatever your supposed to do, you dont know, but apperently you have to do it to even really get into the game. Was not impressed at all and very disappointed from what I played.  I would have liked to play this more and get a good feel for the game. Their is a demo version I am now downloading. Atleast they have this to try the game with. Most game companies have done away with a demo. So I do have to give them props for this even though the free weekend is a disaster. Apperently I am not the only one that feels this way from some of the comments I breifly read.  ---- After playing demo  Ok now that I played some more on the demo, I feel I can review it some more. But I do want to say, any time you spent on with the free weekend is counted towards the demo time which is pretty horrible to do. Yes, I still stand by my ordinal post above. Controls are chunky. You can't even jump, crouch, or crawl apparently in this game. The closest you get to crouching is taking cover next to items. What kind of first person shooter doesn't allow you to do these types of things? Apparently this game.  You have to shoot enemies multiple times. Even head shots with a shotgun could take 3 or more shots unless you basically right on top of them. The semi-auto weapons are really bad. It's like some other posts mentioned, you basically need to unload a clip or two or three at the enemies to kill them. I know I am still using early level weapons but come on, that's not even close to being realistic of fun.  This game feels very poorly made and I can see why their are so many poor reviews. I wanted to like it. I played some Tom Clancy games before in the past and really liked them, but this just feels and plays bad from my short time with it.  It does support VOIP. But you might want to consider just disabling it. Most players I ran into have it activated as its activated by default and they don't use it. Then others have horrible squealing, backnoise, and echoing. Their doesn't appear to be a way to easily mute a single player. But it can be extremely annoying. Especially when you tell someone and the cause you out and deny they have any issues. Your only options are turn down your sound, disable VoIP, or leave the game.","hours":0.9}

Just run to each POI, kill a few guys with the same weapons and armour you had 2 hours ago because nothing better has appeared yet.  The game does offer a narrative and some challenging game play, but I think most of the challenge comes from having to solo a game intended for multiplayer.

I think they might be dazzled by playing their first cover shooter. I'm not.  You would expect Tom Clancy's name to mean a realistic, tactical shooter. And the game plays the part. We have muted colors. Characters pull their weapons out of holsters, not hyperspace. Weapon customization and character abilities are bland - no force fields, no biotic charge. It's a tactical cover-based shooter.  Except that only applies to you. Even low level enemies take a whole assault rifle magazine - or two - to go down. Uncommon enemies have ungodly amounts of health and if they ever figure out to charge right at you, you're in trouble. Look at the reviews, everybody complains about the bullet sponges. The people defending it point out that The Division is part RPG.   You need to grind good enough weapons to do enough damage to enemies. Which means I hardly ever found a balanced encounter - either we were getting rushed by bullet sponges or there was a pile of dead enemies right by the door where they came in. This is made worse by the fact that level - normally a good measure of difficulty in RPGs - doesn't matter as much as gear.  The Division doesn't even do RPG that well. I think they could have been onto something, with instead of tank-heal-damage roles you could have suppression-heal-damage roles. In theory, one player could equip a machine gun with tons of bullets and spray them at enemies to keep them in cover while you flank around. Or one person suppresses the big bad guy while the rest of us fight the little ones. In practice, it's hard to trigger the \"suppressed\" effect, and hard to keep it up because you're outnumbered by bullet sponges. Maybe tank-heal-damage can work, but then I might as well play Overwatch or an actual RPG.  The story is typical Tom Clancy - plausible sci-fi melodrama, boring characters. I can't even remember their names, but half of them are really annoying - e.g. chakra guy.   I do really like the Cleaners faction. They're trying to do the same thing you are - stop the plague, save the world! Except they think they can accomplish it by burning everything and everyone. Kinda cool that half the mooks you're shooting have the same motivation your character does.  If you're ready to give up cool character abilities, fantastic enemy diversity, and colors for a realistic shooter, be disappointed by the bullet sponges. To enjoy the game, I had to ignore the dissonance between the atmosphere and the gameplay, to remember that I'm playing an RPG. With my friends. I would never play this game on my own.

When walking from mission area to mission area there is just.. nothing. No reason to explore, no possibility to interact with civilians (e.g. many civilians proclaim to need food and tries to \"fight\" for it. But there is no real possibility to interact with them; other than point a pistol to their heads to which they will sprint in the other way; pointless). When you have played 10 minutes, you have heard every line of dialogue the irrelevant pedestrians and civilians have. The only \"reason\" to \"explore\" is to participate in Ubisoft's trademarked collectables grindfest.  The world is absolutely beautiful—graphically speaking—but the world feels like a void.   2. It is a grind  The first hour so was okay fun. The enemies died after a few good shots and it seemed somewhat plausible to reality. I am aware this is not a game that tries to be a realistic shooter where you kill enemies after 1-2 well-placed shots, and I am perfectly fine with that. But after said first hour or so—moving onto my third hour—I was faced with the problem I was fearing the most about this game; the bulletsponge.  I was teamed up with 3 random players and we did well together in the first couple of missions. Eventually, however, we had to re-do a mission 5-6 times because we simply could not manage the amount of enemies; eventually we all quit. The mission was at an appropriate level in contrast to our own (I think we were a level or two above the suggested level) and the other guys were actually pretty good. The problem—at least for me—was that it took 2 magazines to kill any one enemy. Long story short; when it takes 2 magazines to kill one guy (most of them being headshots), it takes all the fun out of it. For me, it went from decent fun to absurdity. I do not mind enemies being able to take a decent amount of shots, but when all enemies becomes bullet sponges and require 2 magazines or so to take down, it just becomes absurd and not fun at all.   3. Go-Fetch: The Game  Not much to say. Every single mission is \"Go here. Kill enemies (with absolutely no context who they are. Who the ♥♥♥♥ is Hutch and some Michelle woman? Why am I killing these guys other than just for the sake of it?). Retrieve [enter item/person name/\"push this button\" here] and bring it back. Rinse and repeat\". And sure, most action/shooter games can be boiled down to these three points, but the execution is what makes the game; and this one executes them poorly.   My two cents  If you are into big time grinding and do not care if you have seen it all within 30 minutes, you might like this. I have not played the Destiny games, but I imagine they are quite alike (RPGish, bulletsponging, grinding for better loot). So if you like the Destiny games—or games similar to that—big chances are you will love this. But to me it is just an empty shell that does not offer anything—other than grind from the get-go—and just plainly feels uninspired. I remember how hyped I was for this game when I first saw gameplay of it back in god knows when. I guess I just had other hopes and dreams for what this game had potential for. I imagined thick atmosphere (given the cool premise and setting), a real sense of eerie danger lurking around the corner (crazy civilians or just in general post-apocalyptic fears), innocent people needing my help; actually making a difference. But there is none of that.   I acknowledge some of you believe I cannot \"not recommend\" a game simply because it was not what I was expected. I did not enjoy it, thus, I cannot recommend it. However, if you enjoy these types of bulletsponge/item grinding I say go for it; you might love it. I am not calling it a bad game; it is actually quite okay; it runs fine, graphics are nice, and the concept it ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Th executiong is just Ubisoft/10. I am saddened that they did not do something more with it.   TL;DR  If you like bulletsponge and item grinding, go for it. But that is all this game offers. This game shows its entire hand in less than 30 minutes. It is empty and without soul or any meaningful content.","hours":3}

The game is highly repetitive, all missions really look the same - go there, kill enemies, activate some device.   Combat is boring You only sit in cover and shoot enemies running towards you, no tactics whatsoever. You cannot play stealthy, you cannot one-shot kill enemies or kill them silently in melee.  No realism Killing even the weakest enemies, without any armor, takes about 10 shots from AK-47 or half that if they are headshosts. Enemies often survive frag grenade exploded just next to them.  Non-interactive environment You cannot shoot lights or destroy obstacles – pretty much everything is static and indestructible. There isn't anything to interact with – except ladders and ropes.  Skills are not interesting You can have only up to 3 skills equipped out of 15 available to unlock. There are passive buffs called talents and again you can only select up to 5 (if you reach high enough level, I never got more than one), but most of them are “if you do A, you receive B for C seconds”. There are also unlimited passive buffs called perks which are probably the most interesting. All skills, talents and perks have to be unlocked by upgrading your headquarters which requires quite a lot of grinding.","hours":6.4}

I wanted to try this out for a good few hours to get a good judgement, but it just didn't show off one single thing that was interesting, unique or fun.  The controls (on mouse and keyboard) are also really, really bad. It tries to be \"realistic\" which I find never transfers well into games. I also found the cover system to be annoying to use on top of being cheap.  I can imagine if you just wanna relax and just have a laugh with mates this game might be a good thing to have in the background? Solo is just gonna be a bland generic shooter experience.","hours":1.1}
