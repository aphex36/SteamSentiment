Yes it does introduce some interesting concepts, but they easily get boring late game.  Fortress Sieges: Take a couple of generals with you even though you could do it all by yourself, and when you get to the keep it's rather easy to kill whoever is there unless that person has a legendary orc.  Pit Fights: Seems to be pointless, really. Considering how you'll never hit 5 in a row to let your orc achieve legendary status since you're put against Legendary and Epic almost right away.   The Market: You can ignore it for the most part early game, but then it's obvious how you need Legendary orcs later on to even get the so called ending.  The Story: Incredibly forgetable, honestly don't even care what happens to any of the characters in the story.  Gameplay: Fun but again, repetitive.

{"funny_percent":0.18509824828876445,"helpful_percent":0.5920908515803069,"review":"The controls in this game are unforgivably bad. The game itself is easy (it's more difficult than the first, but still quite easy), but the controls are a constant struggle.  For example I'll want to stop one of my captains from bleeding out during a siege, if he's surrounded by enemies there's almost no chance of actually being able to target him.  If you hold E, it'll try to brand an irrelevant orc. So you'll reposition. With your view looking exactly at your Captain, and Talion (the player character) facing the downed Captain, you'll press E to get him back up, and it'll try to brand an irrelevant orc that is off screen. The lack of targetting is beyond belief for a triple A title. Why isn't it based off the camera direction?  There's a skill that you can get where instead of having to get into melee range and hold E to brand enemy captains when they are broken, you can just use your bow to target them instead and it will automatically grab them after your character teleports within range. This skill is an absolute must because the targetting is non-existant.  Another example of bad controls happens when you run across an enemy who is immune to being vaulted over. Conveniently vault is the exact same button as roll (this is a common theme in this game, one button press has multiple actions). So you'll try to roll, and inevitably vault over the enemy who is immune to it. Wasting time. Once the player has discovered that the enemy is immune to being vaulted over, the game should stop trying to do it. Assume the player isn't an idiot.  If you're standing on a high rooftop, and you want to stealth kill an enemy captain. The captain will be highlighted in red, you'll left click on the mouse to jump off and stab him. Instead it will target an irrelevant orc for whatever reason when the captain is clearly the one highlighted.  It could be a good game, but it's just smothered under horrendous controls. We have 104 keys on a standard keyboard and we're stuck with controls built for a controller. Keys can be rebound, but you can't seperate the functions from eachother.","hours":39.6}

Therefore, I have had limited experience with the online only aspects of gameplay and cannot really comment on them. You can probably guess my feelings about online only features in singleplayer games anyways.  I \"loved\" SoM, as most folks did and still think it's one of the best 3rd person sword slinging games around. With that said, SoW is NOT a worthy successor. Everything about it feels, well, gimmicky compared to the first title. It is currently wrought with glitches such as having your entire army simply disappear, giant white glow bubbles forming over characters, getting stuck in the forced orc intro cutscenes etc. The overall combat feels less fluid, more repetitive, constricting, choppy, and very formulaic i.e. being regulated to using the same stupid combos repeatedly for certain enemies over and over (*cough* Ologs.) The micro-transaction/drop system is pointless and hardly provides incentive to continue playing as Legendary tier sets are rather cheaply animated and lack in any visual variation i.e. one set might be a slightly different color but is otherwise exactly the same. Pause to reminisce upon how lovingly detailed the skins from SoM were. Additionally, with regard to end-game, all those orcs that you’ve cultivated and trained to walk in your footsteps are totally useless once promoted to Captain / Warchief etc. They just sit in your fortresses untouchable and unusable for anything beyond siege defense fodder. I really enjoyed manipulating the Nemesis system in SoM but it seems somehow dumbed down now even though I know it’s been “improved.”   While they've added some new features that expand the gameplay, I found that after the credits rolled I have had no desire to continue playing SoW, unlike SoM to which I have devoted more time than I care to admit. Maybe it's because I'm still raw about everything WB did with their false advertising and hype campaign, maybe it's because what I see in the game seems like a cheap rip-off of the first title rather than an evolution, maybe it's because as a 3D artist I can't help but notice when something's not up to par. I’m sure that as 2018 rears its veiled head Monolith will gradually improve upon SoW, hopefully working out the kinks, polishing the armor and squashing the bugs, but for the time being when all is considered, SoW gets a C- from me.

I will go through each individual issue:   Characters: What's to say about the characters in this game, Talion the main character is as interesting as a turnip, whilst in the first game he was actually interesting to play as, whilst developing relations with others in Mordor, here he is just a turnip going around and hitting orcs. In this game Celebrimbor acts as a petty selfish elf, who only wants to take down Sauron by any means necessary, he is an average sandwich when it comes to the characters but his main fault is that he has the most obnoxious “character development” in the sense that he goes from 0 to 100 in the ♥♥♥♥♥ scale in the final mission of act 2. The rest of characters are all pretty 2d with spirit of Carnan who has actually pretty interesting♥♥♥♥♥♥to say, but the voice acting, is just terrible.  Repetitive mission structure: In the first game the majority of missions where to eliminate/ brand captains and then rinse and repeat until you have finished the game, In the sequel there is enough to keep the stupid entertained but once you really look into the mechanics of the missions they get quite repetitive especially towards the end where they place captains and surround them with hordes of minions (looking at Zog the Eternal) other than that it's pretty bland, go here fight off these guys for a time limit, run here before time runs out and so on, they attempt to throw in the odd dragon or wolf creature thing in to thicken the plot but ultimately it doesn't really work and makes me pretty annoyed as I expected more from WB   MICRO TRANSACTIONS: Okay to be fair you don't really need to pay real money at least if you're not into doing the whole stronghold thing 50 times to get to the final level, I mean the gold coins (Premium currency) is only earned a few times (no more than 5) to my knowledge and your force to buy a pack for 250 when you first get it, my main gripe with the microtransactions is that it's a full retail game and they expect people to pay more money, If i want that I will play a mobile game, not a full fledged game that costs money and it's frustrating because this seems like the future of most games now.   Support team: Right if anyone has had to deal with Origins support team count your stars because they are 10x better then WB’s, I have been plagued with numerous graphical bugs which prevent me from going above 30 fps, no matter what setting, now i'm not running a ♥♥♥♥♥ rig, I have a GTX 1080, 16 gigs of ram, asus maximus IX motherboard and an i7-7700k CPU, they have not been able to help, nor does reinstalling help, it just won't ever go above 30, and it's frustrating because what I can see is that it is a good looking game, I just can't see it, this is a personal gripe with the game but overall this is pretty unique to the individual and should only be thought of if your rig isn't that powerful.   Not worth the price: Right as I stated the jewish law is $1 = 1 hour of gameplay, I purchased this game for black friday and have almost completely finished the game, mind you I listen to every cutscene and I also have done every collectable, I bought the game for 30 USD, which was approximately 40 odd AUD, and I have only spent 19 hours in it so far, NOT WORTH THE MONEY.   Conclusion: overall this is a waste of my money, I would only recomend you get this game once they drop the price to below 25 USD, for if you're a decent gamer like myself you will probably finish it beforehand and it's a damn shame because there are some really interesting Ideas here, such as the nemesis system, but it's overshadowed by the issues with the game, if you want an open world game I would suggest you go buy Assassins creed origins, for you will spend more time in that game then you would in this game.  Overall I would give the game maybe a 5/10 maybe 4.5/10 shekels, only because I am a LOTR fan and i do enjoy the design of the game word.   BTW the map size of the zones are actually pretty small    ","hours":20.6}

BUT THERE IS A HUGE DAMN PROBLEM. THIS GAME IS MEANT TO MILK YOU FOR MONEY. The final act is beyond grindy, all with the express purpose of making you want to just spend money on orcs and items to get through it all. It is without a doubt designed from the ground up for micro transactions. This effectively ruins the gameplay, instead of skill., timing, and practice, it becomes about what items you have, and what orcs you have. It is built around lootboxes. ♥♥♥♥ this trend and ♥♥♥♥ most AAA titles because of it.","hours":44.2}

With the equipment I have from finishing Act III and obtaining all the collectables, I have 10 legendaries and a +28% XP boost (from Gems and registering my email address). Ive put at about 5 hrs on Act IV and I am only level 44 from finishing the game at lvl 42 (max is 60). The grind without paying for XP boosts is UNBEARABLE.   Again, this is only to get through ACT IV. The rest of the game is pure AAA goodness. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE. There are several small bugs in essential systems.   For example, the stealth targeting system. 90% of the time, You will attack the target that is highlighted in red. The other 10% you are at the game's mercy. Needless to say, breaching stealth to kill a grunt instead of the captain that is suceptible to stealth (and immune to everything else) is an easy way to force a player to restart a mission or (even worse) retreat, despawn that captain, and track him down on the map again (holy waste of time). This problem never pops up when there is only one target to stealth kill, but against groups, this becomes a notable time waster.  Furthermore, the parkour mechanic also works 90% of the time. I would be running on what i thought was a straight path. I would hold W + Space (PC controls mind you) and suddenly, Talion dives to the left at an 80 degree angle. Again, This breaches stealth unecessarily (as you leap down from a rooftop straight towards the ground into a group of grunts with nothing to double jump to), but it is recoverable if you aren't facing off against multiple warchiefs. The game also traps you on certain platforms. It specifically traps you on either end of the long straight stretches of rope between roof tops (not the ones you can slide down, the ones you run on).   I would give this game an 9/10 if it ended after Act II. Up to this point it is similar to its predecessor. The difference is a new skill tree, more combat and stealth options, the nemesis system (which is great until Act IV because it becomes a grind), the Drakes, the story, and the maps to play on.  I was not disappointed until Act IV. All I can say is, I wish WB would've kept their dirty ♥♥♥♥ing microtransactions out of what coudl've been and amazing game through and through.   PS: really only worth $40 IMHO. Wait for it to go on sale (and for the love of all that is holy, do not endorse microtransactions in what is mostly a singleplayer experience).","hours":50.3}

I know lots of people harp on the game for shoving in loot boxes and having the last part of the game be so tedious in order to squeeze money out of people, but I feel there's more to it than that.  Maybe it's how any of the characters that aren't orcs are so boring, they make watching paint dry an exhilerating experience.  Maybe it's how the story tries to cram itself into the Lord of the Rings story so much, it's practicaly lore-breaking (ps, haven't watched any of the films/ read the books).  Maybe it's how frustrating the level design is and how it feels like a hassel to get from point A to point B.  Maybe it's how all the upgrades are pointless once you find the ones you want, and it's just there so you can get better loot and orcs.  Or maybe it's how you can no longer dominate an entire area of orcs, leave for an hour, and come back to see the area is still populated with your orcs.  The nemesis system is still fine in the game. In fact, it's even more interesting. Plus, the game is more challenging. However, the good things in this game can't overshadow the flaws, and I end up feeling that something just isn't right with the game.  All in all, if you want a more in-depth Nemesis system and a challenge, this game is okay. Otherwise, I can't seem to reccomend this game.","hours":31.5}

The story line is mind-numbingly stupid, and the gameplay is a pale shadow of what was in the first game. The mission structure is frankly boring and repetitive, and worst of all, you cannot shut the stupid orcs up. Orcs have personality? Good. Orc's have a 3 minute long speech that they give EVERY time they see you? EACH? Not good. Seriously, if you hit a group of orc captains, they will each give a multi-minute intro, one after the other, that you cannot interrupt or cancel. I've had gameplay stalled for 9 minutes solid while the damned orcs talked about how much trouble I had caused, how insignificant I was, and how much acclaim they would get for killing me (in order). The following fight didn't last two minutes.  It is not that I couldn't complete the first chapter of the game because it was too difficult, or because it was broken. I couldn't get through it because it was so lacking in fun. I couldn't bring myself to play it long enough to complete it.  The game play that you loved in the first game? Gone. The challenge? Gone. The solid and interesting story? Gone. The interesting characters? Gone. Any feel at all that you were in Tolkein's setting? Nope.","hours":21.4}

Was excited to hear about the fortresses and all that however really they are just zones in an area like in the first one. When attacking a fortress you don't really use strategy its just get the strongest guys you can and you'll win. If you really liked the first one you'll love this, but if you were like me and felt like the first one was missing something, this won't be an improvement.","hours":25.9}
