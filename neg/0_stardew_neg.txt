I have tried every fix on the Steam Stardew Valley forum posted in the sticky. I have posted my error logs on Stardew Valley's discord, and filed a bug report. But after all of this no one can help me fix whatever is wrong with my game/computer. Since I held onto the game to try and fix it, or hoping an update would come along and solve my problems I am unable to refund the game.  All I can say at this point is I can't play the game due to some unknown error that I nor anyone else can fix, and I can't return it. It will forever sit in my Steam Library mocking me.","hours":25.8}

Fishing is terribly implemented, socializing or advancing the story is also based on grinding long hours for some material or another. If you try to farm you spend all your energy watering every day and have none left for other activities.  Want to automate it with sprinklers? Just grind 40 levels in the mine over the space of a couple weeks to get iron.  Accidentally use up all your energy inside your own house? Pass out and get charged 800 gold by the doctor (?!).  Want to have a conversation with someone? Complete fetch quests that require yet more grinding, this time with usually impossible time restrictions unless you have some of what they want already stocked up. Want to participate in the \"festivals\" or yearly events? Haha too bad you didn't focus on cooking, it's a potluck. Or haha too bad you didn't focus on socializing because nobody likes you. Etc. I shudder to think how much more time I'd have to waste on this in order to even get to the point where I can attempt to enjoy whatever story there might be.","hours":11.9}

If you want to get Grandpa's complete approval, you must be constantly on your toes, trying to figure out people's likes and dislikes, going to places repeatedly to collect random drops for things to complete missions that you're entirely incapable of without doing considerable work building up skills and equipment in time to do so by the third year. It's frustrating, and every single in-game day feels like its own kind of rat race that the player was supposed to try to remove themselves from. Even with some of the greatest gear, getting to low levels in the skull cave is an absolute pain because the bus does not leave until later in the day, even gold pickaxes can’t destroy the rocks in one hit, and iridium ore isn’t really available until one is many, many floors down. I just went through the same day three times because I died twice trying to manage a single iridium ore on a run. I cannot suggest this game to anyone that would feel evenly slightly compelled to beat the game in the timeframe given.","hours":123.6}

I can understand some of the appeal of the game - it's a simple task-based format, focuses on a small area, and allows the character a lot of autonomy in what they do. The map is useful, and in many ways it is fun to whack trees and rocks, plant stuff, 'talk' to the other characters and generally explore.  However, I also found it incredibly frustrating.  - There is very little help available in-game; once you're told how to do something once, that's it, nothing else. I even needed to look up the controls to understand how to interact, as it's not particularly intuitive. - I found various bugs impeded me: for example, I could not get fishing to work, and very often found I was unable to interact with items unless my character was in exactly the right place.  - While there are quest lines available, there is very little direction and once you are given these quests then that's it - the information on them is limited and if you forget (or, as gamers do, exit the game and return) you then have to return to various places to get information again - if you can even remember who gave you the quest!  - I also found the day-cycle incredibly frustrating - it apparently takes half a day to have a conversation, and it meant that my ability to explore felt artifically limited.  I'm sure that if you can get this to work, and get deep enough into the game, then it's great. But for me, even four hours of playing was too much frustration over any enjoyment I got. Not worth it.","hours":4.8}

{"funny_percent":0.0033520097259484684,"helpful_percent":0.014718327488455451,"review":"Stardew Valley is one of those games that makes you wish for a middle-ground rating. There are plenty of aspects worthy of a thumbs up...and enough worthy of a thumbs down that it makes picking one difficult.  Basically, SV is SimFarm welded to a JRPG-style game...fuse SimFarm with Zelda and throw in a splash of The Sims. You're set loose in the game world with a LOT of options at your disposal for how you're going to go about living there. Although the game's focus is farming, yours doesn't have to be; make money fishing, mining, adventuring, or a combination thereof. Craft more valuable items from raw materials, or just sell the raw materials. If you're going the farming route, there are dozens of crops you can plant and tend, as well as animals to rear if that's the direction you'd rather go. Miner/adventurer? There's an abandoned mine full of all kinds of wealth and dangerous critters. Fishing? Pick a patch of water and have at it. As you engage in your activities, you level up skills and gain new abilities.  The town adjacent to your farm is loaded with some surprisingly well-written characters. Pay attention and talk to them enough and you really come to find that they're not one-dimensional copy-paste-with-changed-attributes characters; there are cogent backstories and situations. It's actually quite impressive.   Art style is a combination of SNES-era pixel graphics combined with some quite fine drawn portraits and the like for focus items. Sound is...average, but the soundtrack has some truly memorable pieces in it. So far, so good.  Unfortunately, for all this potential, SV has some serious kinks, errors, and outright faults. Chief among these complaints is the incredibly poor control design. Unless you take time to orient every *single* tool use, you're going to have misfires - and even if you do take that kind of time, you're going to have misfires anyway. And this is a game with combat! Yes, you'll be blindly swinging a sword like Blinkin in Robin Hood: Men in Tights, trying desperately to kill a MOTH before it kills you.   The input system gives you practically no indication what it's going to do when you click, and even with guides and aids enabled, you still can't be sure it's going to behave. Worse, since the same button (LMB) does just about *everything* in the game, it's absurdly easy to screw up BIG. When you go to harvest your crops, don't have a tool in your active inventory slot; you'll OBLITERATE your expensive item rather than harvest it. (The game also gives no visual clue that you have a tool armed; rather than, say, *holding* an ax, it's just circled in the quick-use bar.) Since tool use and activation is, at best, inconsistent, it's easy to make mistakes and cost yourself money.  The sting only gets worse; that money you just cost yourself did not come easily. SV hands out money with an eyedropper, meaning that you'll be grinding endlessly to afford anything. In a way, that's actually pretty cool; it's a more accurate than most representation of farming: you spend days and days toiling away on something that can be destroyed in the blink of an eye to make a subsistence-level living. So, one up for realism.  There's a friendship/relationship mechanic, but it's so horribly convoluted that you *will* need the wiki to guide you. With all the items in the game, and each person having their own likes and dislikes (apart from a handful of \"universal\" likes and dislikes...nobody likes getting seaweed, just like in real life), you're going to need cheat sheets to make friends. And, if you don't talk to them *every*single*day,* they'll forget you're alive and you lose friendship traction. It's infuriating, although nowhere near as badly as the control schema.   At the end of the day, Stardew Valley is a game with tons of potential, giving the player exceptional latitude in deciding how they want to play the game. But the absolutely psychotic control system will send your blood pressure soaring even outside of combat. (In combat...persons with high blood pressure are advised to avoid combat.) Were it not for the ridiculously bad controls, I'd be giving this one a thumbs-up without hesitation. Even with the bad controls, I'd be...inclined to give a thumbs up. But when you add in the game's hefty price tag (currently $16 USD), it tips it over into a no. It's a game I want to like enough to give it an endorsement, but with those controls...I just can't. Ignoring the control issues, it's a solid 8/10. With them, it struggles to make 6/10. And a D just isn't a passing grade.","hours":18.8}
