The puzzles are mediocre at best, but more often lazy and time-consuming for the sake of filling out the game. There is no story except the themes that are inferred.  As a tonal piece of art, Inside nails it in the same way that Limbo did. But for a $20 game being \"pretty\" isn't enough. Portal and Braid showed us how good puzzle games can be a decade ago. Inside feels like a step backwards in terms of gameplay.  The last 10 minutes of the game are the absolute best and are very fun. But then it ends too suddenly to be satisfying. Ultimately, it wasn't enough for me to recommend this game to a general audience.  I finished the game in just over 2 hours. I got it during a 50% off sale ($10) and still felt a bit cheated. If I had finished it in under 2 hours, I would have asked for a refund.  I'd recommend it at $5.","hours":3}

Inside can best be described as \"like Limbo\" and that's ultimately it's biggest flaw. Limbo was a stylized atmospheric game, Inside is a stylized atmospheric game, Limbo has a lack of story, Inside has a lack of story.   Ultimately everything Limbo did, Inside does and maybe it does it slightly better, as the enemies in Inside are a little more believable. But it's a very slight change to the overall game in my opinion.  But the thing is as a new game, I feel like Inside doesn't do enough to really stand out on it's own. If you REALLY enjoyed Limbo and just gotta get more, You can do worse than playing Inside, and that's why I played it. I wanted more.  However I heard how great Inside is, so maybe my expectations are higher than other people but what I really got is a similar game as Limbo with a weaker ending, a story that's feels like it's trying to be make less sense (all the better for fan theories) and a video game it just is lacking a little something that makes it feel rewarding. At one point I paused the game to see how much longer the game was and it wasn't half over. In Limbo this might have made me excited to see what happened next. In Inside, I just sighed, because I wasn't really having fun.   That's the other thing, this game doesn't really put you in a good mood, it's dreary, depressing and draining. That's intentional I think, but it doesn't make for an enjoyable game. Even when you solve a puzzle it just feels like \"ok what's the next puzzle it's going to give me?\"   Even the enviroments are mostly modern with conformity and subjugation as a message, and neither are done in a \"Fun\" way, it's just a dreary game.   If you really loved Limbo, and really just have to have more of it, I guess you could play this, but personally games like Thomas Was Alone, or VVVVV made me feel better, or go grab Limbo at half the price, it's about the same game, and if you really must have more, this is here after that. I think this game got a lot of hype because people WANT to read far deeper into games or talk about theories, but for me. I'd just prefer a fun little game, and Inside isn't that.   Ultimately though, I didn't enjoy this game that much, and I can't really recommend unless someone wants a game to kill a good mood, personally I'm not a fan, and I really wanted something is Limbo and much much more. I got Limbo and that's about it here.","hours":6.4}

I bought this game as it was described as a creepy horror game that raised interesting questions while playing. Instead, I got a very short game that I wouldn't describe as much of a horror game. The gameplay itself is easy to figure out, and for the most part pretty fun. However, the puzzles aren't very challenging, and I beat the game in two hours. Note, I didn't look up any of the solutions online, which if you did, would probably cut actual playtime to 1.5 hours. I spent maybe another hour going back and getting the secret ending completed, which did require online solutions, as its impossible to figure it out by yourself (like any of you would figure out the musical sounds to make on your own)  Its not scary, and only kinda creepy. You mostly solve puzzles. Sure, theres some creepy stuff in the backround, but you mostly run past it on your way to another puzzle. And while you die dozens of times, death is not scary, and quickly becomes an annoyance, and you wish there was a way to speed up the death scene so you can try the puzzle again. Also, after death, you immediately get respawned 5 feet from where you died with no penalty.  So pros: Fun gameplay. Had some fun moments (pretending to be a husk conga line, and the dogs with torch parts) Puzzles not frustratingly difficult.  Cons: Way too short. Wasn't scary (besides the underwater mermaid enemy, and even then only the first death or two) No replay value. Once you found the two endings, and solved the puzzles, its pretty much done. Wasn't worth even $10. I'd consider this a $5 play it once and be done game. ","hours":3.9}

The obvious difference is that this game is in color and has many 3D elements. The charm of LIMBO, however, is gone in this game. I think the problems arise as the game progresses and the timings become very exacting. This is fine for a 3d shooter or full blown action game. This feels like more of a puzzler (as is LIMBO) so requiring exact control inputs and timings with the death and reset mechanics gets frustrating.  The beauty of LIMBO is in the simplicity of the game. INSIDE went a little too far into the action realm. This doesn't mean that the game is bad. It has many fun and interesting puzzles. The mind control mechanic is great and well thought out. The animation and personality of the game is great. The problem is for a casual style side-scrolling puzzler LIMBO is far better.

As it is now I do not recommend this game since you get a really primitive gameplay (you use like 3 keys of your keyboard and thats it) and a rather boring playthrough.  Puzzles are nice here and there but after a while they get repetitive or way too elaborate (not hard) to reach the same result (nothing special as reward). To me Portal 2 did a way better job in that department. The story's inspiration is really nice, almost poetic but its transaction into a videogame is too plain in my opinion. Scenarios and athmosphere are intriguing and well made, these two factors keep up the game otherwise I would have left it in the first 2 hours.

That being said, there is NO way I can recommend this game. While the animation is somewhat cartoonish the content of this game is definitely not for children. If your character gets caught - plan on a gruesome ending, particularly if the dogs get to you. The ending is quite disturbing. I did play it through to the end hoping for some redeemable valuable - but nope there was none. If I could go back, knowing what I know now, I would not play this game.

The game starts off very realistic and dark and it feels like it could be taking place in the same world you and I live in. As the game progresses they throw in some weird alien esque elements while still maintaining a fairly reasonable world design. It looks like an almost dystopian future.  And then it goes to♥♥♥♥♥♥ The game throws out the world design in favor of making elaborate and weird puzzles. The tone has a huge shift and it feels very at odds with the start of the game. Just incredibly strange enviorments that make no practical sense, events unfold seemingly at will to fit the convience of the puzzles. It's as though the developers got stuck half way through making the game and just decided \"♥♥♥♥ it, we need more puzzles, just have you fall 500 feet into a pit and we'll make everything surreal\".  When you get down to it, Limbo didn't really make much sense either in how it was built. But that was far more acceptable thanks to the graphical style and overall weird foreign setting. I felt like Limbo was its own world and it make sense to be weird, it was presented that way from the start. But here it's kind of unfitting and in all honesty I was expecting the ending to be along the lines of \"And then he woke up and it was all a dream\" with the sudden jump into weirdness.   Although this may not be a big deal for some, I felt like it made me very disconnected from the main character and the story. And without that I just didn't feel the desire to continue.

The good: -Good art: it's very atmospheric and has a nice dark ambience. The backgrounds in the game are very cool. Seriously, this game is very good at capturing the feel of a dystopian society.  -Good music: it's subtle; just enough to aid journey. This is how music in games like this should be done.  The bad: -The game's length: it is very short. I beat it in 3.8 hours. -The puzzles: they are way too easy. There was only one great puzzle in the game (you'll know it when you get to it, it's bigger than the other puzzles). Many of the puzzles are more annoying than anything else. Furthermore, many of the enviroments surrounding the puzzles leave you asking \"why would anybody engineer the building this way?\". I get the concept of suspending disbelief but some of the puzzle enviroments seem too absurd to ignore. Example: having the button that unlocks a loading bay 20 feet above the ground, attached to the ceiling. I know it's a puzzle and all that, but that just seems too stupid to believe. -The visual narrative seems inconsistent. The theme is cool, but the game leaves a LOT to be explained. You will have way more questions than answers at the end of the game, and not the good, thought-provoking kind of questions that make you think about your life, but the questions like \"what on earth is the point of having so many flying boxes on poles?\". -The ending is just outright stupid. I know a lot of people like it, but it provides absolutely no closure to the game or its story. Seriously, this is one of the worst endings I have ever seen.   Don't be fooled by the \"overwhelmingly positive\" reviews. This game is all art and no actual meat. I expected this to be an amazing game judging by the steam reviews, but was left very disappointed by its miniscule length, lack of clarity in story, and its terribly abrupt and closureless ending. Would not recommend for a penny over $10.00, if that.  Edit: changed the suggested price from $5.00 to $10.00 because I do feel like this game would be a good value if it went on sale for $5.00. $10.00 is still pushing it and $20.00 is still way too high though.","hours":3.8}

The graphics, the design and the audio is superb, no complaints there, but for some reason I just can't get into the gameplay. A lot of the puzzles heavily rely on trial-and-error, where you have to solve the puzzle with incomplete information, and making the wrong choice means you have to go through a variety of fairly tedious steps again.  One example of this is a certain puzzle with an elevator, it starts at the ground floor, and you can either go up or down, so it's a 50/50 choice which direction you go first, and only one of the sides is the correct way to start the puzzle. This means that if you guess the wrong one, you'd have to figure out that you're in the wrong location, go back to the lift, go up/down twice. And of course this means the animations twice again as well, it really slows the gameplay down significantly, and it's not something I personally enjoy.  Once again, I think the design is great, the game has some very interesting locations that all look amazing, and the game runs 4k60fps on a gtx970, which is very impressive, but unfortunately the gameplay is not for me.","hours":2.2}

That's Inside... Nothing to contemplate about for facts about the journey. The story is completley left to interpratation. Get it if you like that sort of thing. Waste of time for me.","hours":4.2}

However, the puzzles in the game were muuuch easier than in LIMBO. The story was cool and all, but definitely not as satisfying as LIMBO and left me thinking, \"that's it?\" Honestly, I liked LIMBO a lot better.","hours":5.2}

I came into it with high hopes, however the game proved to be tedious and frustrating rather than enjoyable. That isn't to say it was a hard game, it wasn't, however when you have to backtrack across an area at a painfully slow speed and the game relies on you dying to find out a solution it just is not enjoyable.","hours":3.5}

Levels seem to be randomly put together one after another, games lor is never explained properly. Sometimes game hints player what's going on through a piece of background, but at the same time there are the whole sections and mechanics that are there purely for aesthetics and add nothing to the plot whatsoever.   If you are just looking for a stylish casual indie game to play for a couple of hours, that's a perfect choise. Otherwise, you might be left disappointed.","hours":5}
