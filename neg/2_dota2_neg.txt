It is an interesting and fun game to learn, however... Some people are so arrogant over a game. I know I'm that way with CO but never have I ever put down someone or reported them for the issues I faced the other day. ISSUES I Had Lag, the entire game some guy decided to trash talk me the entire time, telling me I suck, I should quit, etc. Telling me I had a $5.00 internet connection as well, and multiple other junk that fabricated out its mouth. SO after researching my issue was not internet connection, it was my Windows 10pro update. Took nearly an hour and reset a lot of things on my pc including my graphics card. I recently updated from 7 to 10pro. My drivers were never installed, I installed it, after the update, drivers were not installed. So after installing it I can play smoothly again.   DOTA 2 - decided that due to reports from this guy and maybe its friends that I can not play for 24 hours, also my lag and disconnection due to lag had a part to play in it as well. I had no control over when I was disconnected, I was able to re-connect but my game continued to freeze until I re-installed my graphic drivers.   That's about all, I'll continue to play here and there but I highly doubt I will spend any more funds on this game. Spent over 10k on another game, why put in to another. Don't know if i Fully recommend this game, some policies need to change. It's a game, play, have fun, learn.","hours":31.9}

But within the last 6 months it seems \"All Pick\" is a sham. Getting matched with humans that have only begun to skin the surface of the Dota universe, I am compelled to vomit. New players are seriously inhibiting the quality of a match. When you know almost everything there is to know about basic gameplay, you can't help but wonder why a Sven would rush a shadowblade. The new or \"wood rigs\" are a severe detrimental abomination to what was once a 5 man Black Hole. It is fact that the only way one enjoys a match (if you can even call a 30 to 4 match) an enjoyment; one must have a 4-5 man party. Whether you dismiss the fact that a teammate has over 2000 more hours than you do, you seem to pick a 1st position Phantom Assassin with only 10 hours played her. Over the latter, it seems that Valve has been pushing the \"All Pick\" or hell, even ranked game-play for \"noobs.\" It is a quintessential fact that MOBAS in their entirety have been watered down over the years. Appealing to those who simply dont know how to call a courier, or the 1st position Snipers who have not even begun to research his kit. For I know this review will go unexamined and that is fine. But the truth is the truth. It is a general fact that the masses are abandoning MOBAS in their entirety. Let the newcomers dangle and fret and whine to eachother in all chat about how one another is the ultimate\"noob.\" I will never read any replys to this review for I will feel like I am in All-chat. To all the Broodmothers who cant take top T1 within the first 10 minutes, or the Nevermores who experience first blood; getting fadebolted by a Grand Magus. GOOD LUCK.  ","hours":3821.6}

Complex machanical system (perfect for those who like strategies) 3. Good graphics Cons: 1. Chaotic and really toxic community (probably the worst I've ever found) 2. Lot's of player don't even know what \"role\" is. Heck! They don't even know how to play! I wonder why they just don't try the learning section 3. Profanities 4. Lots of profanities 5.

After downloading and installing it I tried to play the tutorial. I could not read the text as there where pictures blocking it. I tried restarting the computer, Google and even searched Youtube for someone playing the tutorial so I could read and understand the games functions before going online playing it. Found no solution.  I tried one match online and pretty soon felt disapointment. The teamplay mostly felt like me and my friends ganging up on a lonely player and inflicting damage on him. What I mean is this game is about inflicting damage on others, this is not a healthy game to play if you are dealing with a spiritual awakening.  I wish e-sports where more about building, to heal and purify. This kind of \"violent\" gameplay where you gang up on and inflict damage on other human players are not of my interest. I have no use of feeling of wanting to \"gank someone\" or gang up on someone with my friends.  Sorry if you do not like my perspective of things, this game might be a lot of fun with teamwork. But is it awakening our spirit? If you are dealing with a spiritual awakening this is not a proper game to play unless you know what you are doing.  Here is the bottom line. I simply do not approve of violence or games where you inflict damage on others in e-sports. Esports should be violent free!","hours":0.9}

To those who did play mobas before, if you're coming over from HotS, LoL or SMITE, know this: the skill doesnt transfer over, DotA 2 is more of an RTS than a MOBA, and thus if you expect to trash everyone, you wont.  The new player experience is trash, you meet highly experience players on alternative accounts all the time, low priority is a hellhole for newer people and so on. Its honestly sad how Valve, Icefrog or whoever could fix all these issues never got around to.","hours":92.1}
