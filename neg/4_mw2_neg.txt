The idiotic one where you climb a 80 degree ice cliff fifty feet high with a pair of ice picks. This was clearly made for consoles, but using the mouse controls for the PC, it is impossible to climb that effing cliff. If you have a console then enjoy the game. I have tried to climb that cliiff at least forty times and I finally reached the halfway point before plummeting five thousand feet to my death. What a waste of time and money. If Activision and Infinity had included a skip function at least I could have started at the top of the cliff, but you can't even mission select until you have finished the game at least once I have played MW4 and MW3 dozens of time. Never have I encountered such an effed up mission like getting to that ultra nationalist base in the Altay Mountains. I am one POed Steam and Activision customer.

{"funny_percent":0.04109074830935722,"helpful_percent":0.25403468296558823,"review":"Call of duty series is a huge franchise of war games spawning from WW2 games to depictions of fantasy modern era war, and later version dealing with future tech. This game is obviously taking place in the moder war era but the question is it a good game. I will be reviewing modern warfare 2 with a pro/ con style and ending with my conclusion.  Pro: The single player has an amazing story. The story is a thrill to play and has some very \"edgy\" moments that at the time was controversal but I appriciate that they didnt patch it out. It made the bad guys more of a reason to hate and was no joke a fun mission to do. The rest of the game the player changes characters from SAS and rangers, each character plays a pivital role in the story and do not feel like a generic soldier.  Amazing music. The game has some very emotional and fitting music in the game. I can not say much but it is definantly worth listening to, thank you hanz zimmerman.  Graphics look amazing. The visuals are very breath taking from the a snow storm to a gernade explosion. The particles the game has add to the immersion, like the leaves falling or the wind blowing up trash or debris from a wreckage. Character models look pretty good, especially in cutscenes.  The spec ops bonus mode is fun to play. To the addition to modern warfare series is the addition of the spec ops mode. They are challenges that take experiences from the main game and test players skills. Depending on what difficulty or how fast completed, depends on what star ammount the player earns. The stars are used to unlock additional tiers of spec ops mode which get harder the further gone. Also some spec ops mission are coop only so those are best played with friends since communication is key to success especially on veteran difficulty.  Con: Multiplayer is awful. Since the graphics are so amazing, this can be a distraction. The enemies regardless if they are wearing sniper cammo blend in very well with the graphics because they share the same color scheme. Yes it makes sense in a war but it can lead to many deaths that could be avoided. To add to that, the game has many many hackers. Thats to be expected but it is a disapointment that the multiplayer is still active and no matter what lobby I am in, the experience suffers because hackers kill indefinantly. I got 5 hours on multiplayer and had no fun besides doing a private match with a friend. That leads me to my next issue with the multiplayer, the private matches. Its not fun to go to a private match and not have the ability to goof off with friends like in black ops 2 or black ops 1. The guns and attachments you earned in the multiplayer transfers over to the private match. This cripples the experience with friends because it forces everyone to play the multiplayer to earn their gear and go to private matches to have fun with 1v1 snipers or just combining guns to just have a good time.  Conclusion: The game is good, that i will admit with all the pros i did mention above but the fun to be had with friends is very limited. All the spec ops mission can be done in coop but only a few are manditory coop. The story was a blast to do from start to finish and veteran proved to be quite a challenge. If i want to be honest i can not reccommend the game to anyone. The reason for that is the content for any gamer is so small. If single player is what your looking for than all the campaign is available and most spec ops is available but most people that do call of duty do it for the multiplayer and here at this time it is broken. Spec ops is the only real multiplayer experience worth having since the multiplayer mode is full of hackers and doing private matches with friends leads to disappointment for the only thing that can be used is the pre made classes. The starting pre made classes are just 3 and the other 2 are unlocked later after leveling up a specific ammount. So in order to have fun with friends everyone needs to go into the multiplayer mode and play online matches to earn the gear that they want to use with friends. Such a grand idea fails to add enjoyment to the game and will cause players to put down the game sooner than they expected. Even if there was a combat training to level up in a private matches separate than online level ups similar to black ops 1, then I would be ok with that. That is not the case and being forced to play a broken online mode to get slaughter by hackers all the time...no thanks.","hours":22.9}
