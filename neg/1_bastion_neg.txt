After playing through it this weekend I have no idea why.   The art is beautiful with interesting character designs and unique looking enemies, but that's about where the positives end.  It's about some kid with a hammer whose floating city was destroyed and he's trying to fix it. It's a simple story and there's nothing wrong with that, but they try to stretch out any emotion or meaning from the ever present narrator. And this guy never shuts the ♥♥♥♥ up. There's three human characters in the game to talk about and it's dragged out the entire game.  They made the narrator emulate some kind of cowboy and there wouldn't be anything wrong with that if every visual, story element and gameplay mechanic didn't point to fantasy. There's no indication that a western themed narrator or music would service the story or visuals in anyway. I guess there's a saloon in the beginning of the game? But it looks like a fantasy tavern anyway. It's like they watched Cowboy Bebop combine genres and thought that was a good idea without understanding why it works.  The game is too damn linear. If I drew a squiggly line with a couple turns that would be as complicated and interesting as the layout gets in this game. The ground popping up in front of you is eye catching until the seems start showing a couple levels late. At first it seems like the novelty of the path popping up in front of you is what is limiting the design of the game, but I've played the developers other title Transistor which is similarly linear, so it's just lazy design.  I don't understand why it was so popular. Maybe good looking indie games were rare in 2011.  TLDR: + Beautiful Art  - Clashing Themes - Too Linear - Never ending Narration","hours":4.9}

It's essentially an isometric combat-based RPG, kind of like Diablo without randomized levels, loot, skills, etc... The combat is ok, and there's a good variety of weapons, but you choose only two for any given level. And the levels are fixed, so if you want to play through again then you will be playing the exact same levels over and over. It's a fairly short game (less than 8 hours to complete), which is actually a good thing in my opinion. There are a good number of additional difficulty options you can assign as desired, and a lot of achievements to unlock, but for hard-core gamers, I just don't think it will be worth the effort.  The one thing it has going for it is story, and a narrator that constantly narrates every move you make. But it's just not that interesting.

Even without anti-aliasing it looks really good.  Gameplay: ======== The controls are nice, everything works as intended. Controller support is very good, didn't play it with mouse and keyboard though.  Characters: ======== I think my main problem with the game is, that I can't identify with the character. In most games you have a moment of desperation, something that sparks even a little fire of emotions in me, the death of an NPC, who was valued by the playable character, something that makes me either love the playable character or hate the NPCs. In this game there is nothing like it. There is no background on the playable character before you wander off into the unknown, there is no information on the enemies. They are just something that attack you for no apparent reason. Other than \"oh, they are probably the enemies, I should fight them because they want to kill me for no reason\", there is nothing that makes me want to fight them.  Difficulty: ======= I don't like the difficulty. I tried the \"normal\" mode, wich was kind of hard. The general difficulty of this game is hard, I'd say. Then you have the \"no-sweat mode\", a mode that still lets you die, but not for good. You press a button and rejoin the current fight without losing anything. In that mode the game is more of a story, than a game, since you just have to mash the attack buttons and can revive yourself after a death again and again. Problem is: I want a game, not a story. Paired with the unlikeable characters a too high or too low difficulty makes me not want to play the game anymore.  Which is why I stopped.  Conclusion: ======== Not for me. I need to emotionally connect to the playable character, either because of cuteness, coolness, sadness, happyness, you name it. I can't connect to \"the Kid\" at all.","hours":4.4}

It looked so good: colorful environment, interesting concept of the world building itself as you explored it, lots of potential customization in weapon choice and which drinks/gods to invoke, and a storyline which is told via real time narration.  The problem is that the game's combat is repetative and difficult. It is very hard to avoid getting damaged by enemies while fighting; they come in big crowds that will quickly surround you. You can roll out of the way or use a shield to block attacks but it's never enough. Firing a ranged weapon requires standing still. The only way to really play this is to rush into battle while constantly drinking health potions. It rarely matters what kinds of weapons you use; you can basically upgrade any weapon to do whatever you want it to do. The optional modifiers from drinks or idols only add marginal benefits that aren't really noticable unless you start stacking them, and even then it doesn't really change the fact that battles are long slogs that require numerous health potions.  I have tried three times to play this game. Each time I promised myself that I'd see it through to the end. Each time I had to quit because I got so incredibly bored of playing the same, \"hack through a mob of badguys\" gameplay that every level had. The game's storyline was too vague to really engage me.

It looked (still does) like a beautiful game with a story that kids could be happy with. But after noticing their lack of interest, I wanted to try it myself.  It's tedious. Annoying. Unforgiving. I can't believe they made an isometric game with ranged weapons so hard to aim. You need to spend a few attacks to get the right angle. AND it feels like aiming is not free-look. there are hops in your rotation angle so no matter how you try, sometimes you need to get a better location to hit a target. Playability gets hurt because of this. This FORCES you slowdown your pace. In the end, I was not caring much about enemies because why to bother with this tiring, kinda unrewarding task.  To top it all. You have a shield which allows you to deflect and counter attacks. Nice, right? A static enemy shoots an energy ball at you. You use your shield, towards it, right in front of it. And the darned energy ball hits the shield and goes sideways. Hmmm...kay, you think, let's deflect the attack to another enemy. Wrong. The next energy ball goes directly to the original attacker. WTH. What kind of math they used to code this? Random?  Oh, and the pauses in the controls. There are pauses after you attack, pauses even before some attacks (e.g., charging bow), pauses after you roll...this game does not make up its mind. Is this turn-based or what? Because I see the enemies constantly hitting you, like if this was more on the arcade side. And by \"pause\", please understand that annoyingly long period of time where you can't repeat the previous action. Just slowly move thinking of the next thing to do, and being punished in the meanwhile.  The scenary, beautiful. But the fact that you can fall down on the edges, yet fly over some holes, is beyond me. What are those holes in the platforms for? Showing us a cute transparency or parallax effect? The same rules should apply in the whole map.  Sigh.  There are some parts of this game absolutely well done.

I heard the music and narrator and thought that the game will be amazing.  Sadly it just didn't come together. This game is a very weird mix of kawaii anime characters and gritty \"adult\" cowboy story in a cruel world. The whole game is narrated with a voice of self-affected gunslinger, who tries to inflate every minute of gameplay with pathos — it is so serious that it becomes pulpy. This makes it easy for the player to judge the story, or even to stop enjoy it at all. Some challenges are just meant to test player's patience in oldschool way: if you failed, you must start the whole exercize all over again. This extraordinary beautiful game gave me almost 5 hours of, basically, swearing on unforgiving gameplay and inability to save and load when I want.   Maybe I'd like this game if I loved anime, or just didn't have any expectations from Bastion.

The reason why I do not recommend it is because its gameplay, which is arguably its weakest aspect.  First, the core combat seems to be built on conflicting principles. On one hand the player is supposed to rely a lot on muscle reflex, dodging and flanking enemies in between their attacks. On the other hand, the terrain is rather punishing because it’s very easy to fall off the map while dodging around, getting hit by monster from different directions due to the inflexible switch-target mechanics of the shield blocking, and also where monsters’ attacks are largely not “telegraphed” but rather demands players to memorize the exact time between their attack animation finishes, and when the actual attack occurs.  Next, there is an excessive amount of weaponry compare to number of maps. Due to weapons are discovered and players are expected to use them until completion of the map, the system where players upgrade and keeping a favorite set of equipment is weakened. This issue is felt even more acutely at the final stage of the game, where just shortly before the player is given a “super cannon” that basically outranks every other ranged weapon in the game, but you aren’t so lucky to have any time enjoying it… as the latter half of the final stage locks the player into a new, and extremely unwieldy “environmental” weapon until the game ends.  These are just some of the highlight where I feel this game’s gameplay employs “difficulty by annoyance” kind of tactics, and is gating players from the good stuff, namely, the art style, the narration, the story (except the ending might be a bit let down). This being said, the game doesn’t pass my own “should I play it or just watch gameplay video on YouTube” test. So yeah, Bastion is a game that’s better “watched” than played yourself. ","hours":7.4}

To avoid spoilers let's just say the main character of the game becomes the only living person in the world. And it has an interesting way to tell story as well, narration. But that is the problem for me. After about several chapters, I lost interest in the character, because he has no dialogue. All of the dialogues are from another man narrating the story from far away. He left no impression of his own, so why do I have to care?  VISUAL: 4/5 They did a good job when creating a world full of colors and objects. You can see the ambient of each location. The only thing that's missing is the feeling that this is an inhabitable world. Sure there's houses, shops, but it doesn't showed that this is the world where the protagonist once lived. It just seems so static. GAMEPLAY: 3/5 The game tried to put many playstyle into one game. If you prefer constant smashing, there's the hammer. If you prefer careful shooting, there's the arrow. The problem is, you can only carry 2 weapons at one time. It means that the game's difficulty can increases considerably if your setup is not suitable for the mission (and there's no way of knowing if it is). As I play the game it becomes clear that you only needs to upgrade some of the weapons, making the others useless content. Also the enemies is pretty generic, there are many types but not too uncommon comparing to other games. PERFORMANCE: 5/5 For a light weight game, it's good.

And that's just the problem. It's a mediocre game, checking off all the boxes for an ARPG but doing nothing interesting or new.   Looks nice, plays dull, story is pretty bad, and the narrator sounds like someone left CSPAN on. Seriously the narrator gimmick is the worst part about the game, it doesn't really add much, especially considering the story is pretty terrible and the characters are mega bland.  I can't recommend this game. There are older games that are FAR FAR better action rpgs (Terrenigma and the Zelda series come to mind), and there will be future games that will be better too. Save yourself money and time, do not buy and play better games.","hours":6.6}

It has a great artstyle and an interesting enough story but the combat is way to shallow for me to actually care about the game as a whole. It's a good thing the game was so short because it felt like a slog actually going through it. The music was pretty good, too.","hours":5.4}
