This game can be fun by yourself if you just want to build something cool or just mess around. But if you get it just to play the multiplayer then you are going to have bad time.  The Multiplayer in Garrys Mod is either good or just cancer as hell. There are some very neat cool things in the Gmod online community but there is very little of it. The rest of it is just plain garbage. The people who play are either 13 year olds who try to act edgy and cool and there are the, \"Serious Rpers,\" and these people are the defention of AIDS.  The only way I see for someone too have fun is to get a group of friends and just have fun, so I don't really recommend Gmod to really anyone unless you know what you're getting into.

Next: The servers, sure you COULD look for a fun server...If your ready to wait hours to download the content for them, most \"roleplay\" servers are just idiots messing around while youtubers record it. HL2RP is freaking boring! It is essentially just minges and citizens waiting around in industrial 17 instead of city 17 for something interesting to happen, sometimes making awkard small talk. (As someone who in real life is not too social and does not want to spend who knows how long talking to someone, I sure as hell dont want the feeling of small talk emulated in a VIDEO GAME!) When something interesting DOES happen, the citizens are shooed away while the CP officers and OTA soldiers take care of it. Definitely not worth overwhelmingly positive.","hours":74.9}
