I would risk getting the xbox disk took off me when i was 14 because I have strict parents and I would always play it at a friends house we would play zombies together and play for hours so I decided to buy it on PC when i moved to the glorious MASTERRACE but i was a bit disappointed because at first it was extremely laggy even though I had a GTX 970 at the time. Now I have a 1080 and the performance is way better (90+ fps on max settings). Then it happened, BOOM sudden and unexpected crash (I usually play about 2 multiplayer games before it crashes). idk why but every 15 mins the game crashes and gives no information on why it had crashed so I can't find a fix for it so treyarch. PLZ FIX!  I do recommend this game, ON CONSOLES... on PC it just isn't stable enough.","hours":13.7}

However, I can be wrong. this issue can be passed on to further CoD titles as well.  But I'm gonna talk about this Black Ops title in particular.  Take for example your main protagonists like Woods, Hudson and Bowman etc...  They can take like a billion bullets and not die, but it only takes like a mere 3 to 5 shots  from an enemy AR to kill you...  Now realistically speaking, that would be a fair game,  if it wasn't for the fact that you are a bullet magnet! enemies have godlike aim.  Enemies can literally shoot you through the smallest hole,  not to mention there will ALWAYS be a three quarter portion of the entire enemy faction that will focus fire on you, and YOU only regardless of whether you're in cover or not! This doesn't bode well on your side, knowing that friendly AI is braindead.  I had cases where a friendly main character runs behind the same cover where an enemy was. this character decided to run back and forth 3 feet in that same room for no reason, yet the enemy decides to shoot me instead while that dumbass runs out in the open next to him.  Hell, If you stand on any of the protagonists' scripted cover path nodes they will most likely push you from that cover, therefor indirectly allowing for you to be killed. They also have an insufferable habit of running in your way and even run in the open in your line of fire... I also had one occassion where Reznov was draining 3 mags full  at a low piece of wooden cover with no enemy behind.  Generally speaking, when you're in a larger skirmish, friendly AI just scatters fire around everywhere, not prioritizing any targets whatsoever  like shooting enemies that are closer or out of cover.  instead they fixate fire on any target until it's down.  Occasionally changing mind when they get shot. I like playing the hardest difficulty for achievement hunting,  but the braindead AI makes it a test on how long I can keep my sanity. Wasn't a big load of this crap also present in CoD WWII?","hours":53.9}

Unfortunately, multiplayer is not fun anymore since server admins dictate your every move. You can't do this or that or you'll get kicked or banned from that particular server.

(well I got it for 10) what do you pay for? singleplayer mode. multiplayer is dead. I checked the servers today and there were a couple of servers with a ping below 120ms. On of them even had some people playing on it. It was a french zombie survival server.  so... multiplayer is dead. even more dead than mw2 and mw3 (didn't think that was possible) you only buy this game for story mode, survival mode or to play Zork in the main menu :P  the gameplay and guns feel smooth. Too bad there is nobody I could shoot at.","hours":6}

You shot stuff endlessly until mission ends. There is no reward, Not unlike the past Call of duty game that gave you the impression of helping end the war.  It also reminds you what special ops are for : mindless murderers for power.  !!! Spoiler alert !!! : all the missions are fake brainwashed flasbacks, except the ones you actually see Woods, which is a giveaway that your in ''reality''. Because Mason is too stupidly dumb, he's been implanted souvenirs.","hours":19.4}
