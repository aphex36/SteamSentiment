Story-wise, I think Valve could have done better, starting with the huge inconsistencies between the two games . This especially goes for the excuse plot behind PeTI. However, the worst of offense is that some of the alternate universe storylines go beyond the realm of science fiction and are outright demonic in nature. This is inappropriate for a science-fiction game to say the least.  Also, the vulgar language in this game is the reason I have not live steamed it. And just like the first game, there's really not that much replay value except for challenge mode and extra achievements that you missed on your first go-around. Overall, I wish I had never purchased this game.","hours":59.7}

The complete lack of ANY communication for TEN YEARS is completly disgusting, It is disrepectful to the fans who supported valve for years. Its sad that valve doesnt even have the courtesy to tell their fans that half life is dead. It is clear that we will never get a satisfying ending to an amazing story. I personally am not interested in anything valve has released since Episode 2, and if the single player story driven masterpieces of recent years are anything to go by, its that valve only cares about its games as service titles, and not their narative driven campaigns. I am deeply upset that we will never get to explore the atmospheric and exciting universe of half life again. Valve prides themselves on their independance and flat workplace structure, but its clear there is a lack of focus. Valve, like too many companies in the video games industry, seem to be too blinded on following the money, they have left behind those that got them there in the first place...","hours":14}

(for u salt master xDDD)  You see, lodaing times are huge which take up almost the entire game. They're annoying.. I feel like I should mention that the full game is 9+ hours and about 2/3 of the game is load screens.  TO JUSTIFY  I'm not saying that portal 2 is a bad game at all, in fact, if you have the patience to go over 300 loading screens, be my f**king guest, buy it through♥♥♥♥♥tho. 15 dollars is an insane price for the game. (due to gameplay and variety, you should play it, but please continue with this review)  OK IM DONE NOW  Portal 2 storywise sucks bongo di**.  big deal. I'd say that introducing and developing new characters, making them likeable, to ruin it, is not a good move. Take Half-Life 2 for example. Judith Mossman. Not a likeable character compared to Alyx or Eli Vance. Makes a relationship, to ruin it, to fix it and to make 2 sequels because of her. Wheatley ain't sh** compared to Mossman.  that's it. I'd much prefer playing DOOM 1 or 2, Titanfall 2, Half-Life 2 and even the original Portal. I can't find the fun in Portal 2. I hope that justifies my point, salt master.","hours":6.8}
