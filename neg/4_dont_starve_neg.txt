{"review":"I don't see how this game has so many positive reviews.  The game is pretty, and has nice visual and sound. The first hour was fun. Initial exploration, crafting stuff, staying alive. But then what? There's no endgame I'm working towards--just seemingly endless tiers of things I can craft. I have no motivation to do so, as I'm on day 12 and I seem to be surviving just fine with grass and fire and berries and a house.   There aren't even any acheivements to unlock to drive me to try to do weird things in the game. I've crafted what I need to survive so far and I don't know where to go from here.  This would be sorta fun if not for the permadeath. It's hanging over a shadow like everything I've built. I might play some more, but when the character dies, I don't think I'll be starting again. Why would I want to go through all this initial boring build-up again, now that I've already seen it all?  I paid $3.74 for this game, and I guess that was worth it for an hour and a half of entertainment.

I don't see how anyone who doesn't have a photographic memory could enjoy (or play) this game. It is also extremely tedious in that you have to spend way too much time repeatedly clicking to harvest enough ingredients to make anything, it is far too easy to die, and the controls are idiotic (e.g. why does changing the view 90 degrees need to be assigned two whole buttons?). The pacing is all off given what the character needs to get done to survive. And why are recipes or other game info not accessible while the game is paused?

{"review":"I genuinely wanted to like Don't Starve, but the game's core mechanic of \"collect grass and twigs\" just doesn't keep me entertained.  I enjoy a good challenge, and I don't even mind the permadeath feature in survival games. By the time I finally got the hang of the Don't Starve, surviving through winter with ease and defending my camp from invaders, I had sunk 25 hours into the game. I was shocked, because I only felt like about ten percent of this playtime was fun. The rest of the time was monotonous wondering to collect the same basic supplies, and craft the same basic items, over and again. The only challenge was in playing long enough (or consulting the wiki) to figure out a winning build strategy.  The art is captivating, and I enjoyed touring the scenery during my first couple explorations of the vast open world. But this, too, became a chore on replays: I found myself dreading the start of a new game because of the prolonged exploration phase,   Although the game features caves, adventure mode, DLC, and community mods, I don't feel like replaying any more is worthwhile. Sure, there's a style to how you play this game, but there simply isn't enough variation to make my survival strategies or base designs drastically different.   I'll admit that part of my bias comes from my living situation in a rural wooded setting. I am fortunate enough to be able to collect grass and twigs in my backyard, which I can burn in my stone (well, brick) fire pit. I don't have to watch for Deerclops, but I do have plenty of wildlife and vermin that require attention. If l lived in a dorm room or in the city, then Don't Starve might be a nice substitute for a breath of fresh air.   If crafting and survival is your thing, then I highly recommend Don't Starve. But for me personally, this game lacks fulfillment and provides only a time sink.","hours":33.7,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.5}

From my 1 hour experience of Don't Starve, it seemed much like pointless walking with some odd encounters (quite boring ones at that) here and there.

{"review":"I wanted to like Don't Starve, but unfortunately it lives up to its name entirely too well. Supposedly there's an actual story to follow, and things to do and see, but you will spend so much time setting up your food, maintaining your food, hunting for more food, growing food, and trying to find ways to preserve your food as it rots faster than a Durian left under a heat lamp in a sauna, that you will never actually get to see anything but your camp, wherever the local poop supply is, and the occasional 1 or 2 screens out as you are chased by some massive monster you have no hope of even being able to damage, much less kill.  Edit: Additionally, if you don't like the game apparently the people who do feel the need to constantly point out how any dislike you have for it is somehow a fault with you, as a person, as a player, or for whatever other reason.

{"review":"The game is pretty fun at first. There is only one problem. Save Game Deletion. Every time you die without first spending 10 hours collecting stuff to make an effigy your save gets deleted. This should be an option like it is with most other survival games. Most will disagree with me on this but the game is only truly hard at key points. The rest of the time is spent exploring and collecting stuff. Exploring and collecting stuff is fun at first but when you collect the same stuff for the 20th time in the same areas you collected them before it just gets frustrating to start over and do all of that over. It is annoying.   People often talk about balance but this game is not balanced at all. The deletion upon death just wasn't done right. FTL did it right because it is a short game and the whole way to the final boss is fun. This game likes to make you do remedial tasks that are only fun the first few times and when you finally do get past a tough part there is little to no reward. You never really want to build up your base because you know it will be deleted. Imagine playing Dark Souls but every time you die you have to start completely over. If you run into something hard and are not prepared you are starting over. If you are prepared it is fairly easy to overcome.  Games like this are what I call a fake challenge. They use a bunch of annoying gameplay mechanics to trick you into thinking the game is hard when in reality the only hard part is starting over when you die. Every boss or tough creature has it's weakness and once you find it winning is easy. But since you start over every time you die, finding that weakness becomes hard. Then you resort to google and find their weakness. But then you are like damn I have to do all of that nonsense before I get to try again. Guess I will just watch Netflix until I want to try again or write a crappy review about the game and remember why I quit in the first place.   I'm giving this a thumbs down because the only way to play this game without growing gray hairs is to download a mod that lets you keep your save (and they do exist). You have to be a masochist to like this game without one.","hours":15.5,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0}
{"review":"The game looks beautiful and has a really unique style but honestly... it's pretty boring and vague Your main objective it obviously to stay alive and that's about it You aren't given any clear goals and there isn't any proper building mechanics either There is barely any crafting, the sense of progression is lacking and there isn't any rewarding aspect to the game   This is what you do in don't starve: -Run around during the day looking for something interesting -When the night comes you set up camp and wait until it's over -Maybe you'l leat some of the food you found or look through the small crafting menu -When the day comes again you keep running around looking for something cool, maybe you'll find it, maybe you wont -Maybe you'll die from something and have to start over -Maybe you find something cool, look at it for 5 minutes and move along -Repeat   I'm honestly a bit scared to say negative things about this game becuase of the huge cult-like following it has. It's compareable to the dark souls community, that if you say anything negative or point out flaws in the game you'll instantly be bombarded with insults from from diehard fans telling you things like \"you're just bad at the game\" \"this game isn't like other games you're used to\" \"this game doesn't hold your hand\" \"you just don't GET it!\" etc. while at the same time they pretty much refuse to see the flaws of the game and see the perspective of others who have a different view than them","hours":2.8,"funny_percent":0.16666666666666666,"helpful_percent":0.16666666666666666}
