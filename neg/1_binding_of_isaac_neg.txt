{"review":"Oh dear god, this game will eat your life. Get out before it's too late. I've sunk over 200 hours in and I can't say it was a pleasant experience. Don't fall into the trap.  Seriously though, while this game can be very entertaining with the item combonations that you can make, the actual progression and combat is bland and options for progression are lacking. Most of the rooms are combat-based and a few are \"puzzle-based.\" The combat rooms, while occasionally entertaining, are mostly tedious, and the puzzle rooms are simplistic and extremely tedious. The game is incredibly replayable (I wasn't lying about the 200 hours thing), but that's not neccessarily a good thing when the actual act of playing it is dull. Get addicted to some other game.  Or perhaps I shouldn't be judging so harshly a games I've sunk so much time into. If you want something to get lost in and nothing else, I guess you could do a lot worse. Watch some videos on the game. If it looks like something you'd like to play, it probably will be, but for me, I kind of wish I hadn't bought it.

{"review":"Edit - Oct 14, 2017: So this review isn't helpful? If you truely think this review isn't helpful, you're what's wrong with the game industry. Not only did the publisher censor bad reviews, this game has a DLC for its DLC, and you're defending this practice.  Let me start by saying that The Binding of Isaac is an amazing game. The DLC is where the sh*t hits the fan, and is the reason I'm giving the negative review. You might be thinking to yourself; \"Hey, f*ckface! Why not put the negative review on the DLC page?\" I can't. Nicalis put Afterbirth+ in a bundle to ward off the negative reviews it was getting; a tactic that's generally used for lazy asset flips.  Afterbirth+ is quite possibly the only example of a DLC for a DLC. Yeah, every game has DLC these days, but this is just ridiculous. Anyway, lets see what AB+ adds: A \"new\" floor made entirely out of assets that were already in the game, a \"new\" boss who is also made from reused assets, another alternate version of each floor (actually new content), a few items that are variations upon already existing items, mod tools (see explnation below), and small rooms full of enemies and enemy spawners.  So, other than flipping a few assets, the DLC for the DLC adds variations of each floor, and mod tools. In other games, Civilization for example, mod tools are free to anyone who owns the game. Not only is it free, but its easy to use.  \"Hey, sh*tlord! Just disable Afterbirth Plus!\" - Ah. You see, just like with the original Binding of Isaac, bugfixes are only avaliable to people with the DLC.","hours":157,"funny_percent":0.03571428571428571,"helpful_percent":0.42857142857142855}
{"review":"When it comes to the binding of Isaac rebirth the term if it's not broke don't fix it comes to mind. When it first came out it was better then vaniliah Isaac. With new items, characters, different enemies, and floors. well times have changed. With DLC and \"booster packs\". too many items in the item pool do the same thing. Since the item pool is flooded, and damage is at a premium. I find myself constantly 5 floors in and still have based damage, and this is getting every deal with the devil. Even deals with the devil are not as good....  The game is a shell of what it once was. Because of the dlc's(Thanks afterbirth+) and constant a slow trickle of updates that add very little but reskined items. They also change already good and fun items to be less enjoyable. So myself and others have resorted to hold R until you get a good item on the first floor, which you should not have to do.    I feel the game has shifted from very fun and enjoyable to unbalanced and frusterating. Why even bother taking pills now? There are so many pills 13 to be exact and half of them do the same thing. So don't even bother taking pills and just ignore them all together. Which leaves not only moms bottle of pills useless, but PHD pretty much usless too. That right there sums up what this game has become.    With all that being said Mods make this game more balanced and in my mind a hell of a lot more fun. So I give this review a moderate thumbs up with mods.....but thumbs down without.","hours":344.6,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.38461538461538464}
{"review":"based on experience with afterbirth+.  At this point I have to say that I liked original version with expansions more than this version. yes it has more stuff now, yes it has more enemy variety now, yes it has more room variety now. It sounds wierd, but exactly that variety - is what actually makes this game less and less fun for me. If in earlier iterations you could say \"ah, this item is bad, but I'll take it in case I'll find other item that buffs effects of this\", now you won't say this just because chances of finding an item you want are now dangerously close to zero. Earlier when you heared of people, who restarted the game unless they get desireble first item, you'd smiled on them weaklings, now its the only rational way to play, otherwise you'll be constantly hoping of getting \"next item that finally fixes this run\" for dosens of minutes, till some random chain of events will put you in unwinnable position. Basically the only positive for this game for now is recent addition of workshop. Mods that avaliable in workshop can fix all of this game's issues, but it's not what i \"review\" here.","hours":71.4,"funny_percent":0.038461538461538464,"helpful_percent":0.5}

{"review":"After playing this game for a very long time, I've figured out that the game is pretty much completely dependent on you getting damage upgrades.  Damage is the only stat that matters. And there are many runs where you simply cannot find any damage boosting items, so later in the game you just get worn down because it takes you so long to kill enemies and eventually you'll make mistakes and get hit.  If you get damage boosting items, congrats you'll do well and win you're run.  That's pretty much all there is to the game.

{"review":"I have some unpopular opinions. My review is at 1.9 hours because that is my absolute limit for stomaching this game.  DISCLAIMER: I am no stranger to repetative, difficult, or grindy games. I grew up with, and still play, the NES. That being said....  PROS: • A creepy storyline that grips you at first • Randomly generated levels & items promotes continuing/replay • Character, enemy, and boss designs are clever and well done • The music is pretty good  CONS: • Game boasts difficulty, but the difficulty actually stems from clunky controls, poor weapon design, and bad hit box locations. • You are not told what items actually do, so you need to alt+tab and refer to an external resource to find out. • Repetative. One life. You die once and you start all over losing all items and progress. This isn't usually a problem with other games, but here I felt like I was working towards nothing. It's just not worth the boring grind when all you get is a picture of the stuff you previously found put into a log. *yawn* • Sorry, but I have to mention it. The levels are so ugly. In all honesty; its poop brown. Poop everywhere! Blood, sweat, and poopy tears! The game starts out interesting with a wacko mother, but then you are forced naked into a bloody poop infested dungeon? Seriously? I'm not that interested in finding out why the poop is so important to this little boy's story.  CONCLUSION: I do not recommend this game for it's flawed controls, poor design, and ugly repetitive gameplay. I'd rather just read the storyline on wikipedia, watch the endings on youtube, and then go play some original Zelda (good gameplay), Tales of the Maj'eyal (a true roguelike), or Dark Souls (repetitive grind with difficulty relying on actual skill).","hours":1.9,"funny_percent":0.07407407407407407,"helpful_percent":0.07407407407407407}
{"review":"TL;DR I would give a positive review for \"The Binding of Isaac\" and a negative one for \"The Binding of Isaac : REBIRTH\" because : - it does not improve from previous problems (in-game descriptions) - it does worse on some part (music) A bad rebirth for a great game. --------  I love this game (art, story, music are unique)  BUT  there is a fatal flaw : you must constantly alt-tab (or use a 2nd screen) to check the effects of items / trinkets /cards/ pills. It ruins gaming immersion. OK for not explaining the first time we pick an item, but after that do you really expect us to remember effects of 341 items ? Is it SO complicated to include description \"in-game\" ?  I don't know if it's lazy coding or a game design mistake...  And old music were really better (for my taste).

{"review":"TL/DR: Not even on Sale. This doesn't suit Casual play and will endanger the health of Completionists through stress and physical injury from headdesking/fist through walls etc.  I really truly wish I could recommend this game to you, and this time last year I still may have.  I got into The Binding of Isaac (Wrath of the Lamb) just prior to Rebirth coming out and was able to notch a few hundred hours in it and was very excited for Rebirth. This excited state kept going throughout the period up to Afterbirth, with me bashing my head repeatedly at trying to unlock (or rather gain max lvl in runs) both Meat Boy and Bandage Girl as well as complete The Lost. Despite Items having been changed/nerfed since release with the pretty regular updates during this period, I still enjoyed each run even when not always successful.  Then Afterbirth came in and I continued to enjoy the game with the additional Greed Mode, Dailies, challenges and new characters and Items, going for unlocks and testing the interactivity between pickups, sometimes just seeing the 'Zany'.   More updates happened, tweaks occurred to 'rebalance' certain interactions between Items and Characters. These appeared to occur slightly more frequently than during the Rebirth phase, and the direction seemed to be headed far more into the game 'trolling' you (admittedly the troll aspect was part of the game from the outset, so perhaps I should say it was headed more to a nastier troll i.e. no longer the mutual laugh of a well played harmless prank).  The problem is, as each update hit, it followed the same pattern of nerf/screw with player. The Keeper was a tough character to play is in the early days of Afterbirth, but penny dropping items helped and made it actually possible to complete a run (another admission, I never actually have 'won' a Keeper run, I've got to Isaac a couple of times, but never further). However, these items/trinkets got hit with changes so their effects were negated or at minimum much reduced when playing Keeper, so these avenues for success no longer exist.  A couple of months prior to Afterbirth+ release, it was not fun any more. Runs were taking at least 45 minutes to complete (when successful), Boss Rush and Hush were rarely happening, the Item pools/offerings were uninspiring or outright useless (in context of completing a run) and it seemed each run was directed by a spiteful little child (you know that kid, the one who really needed a spanking from their parent).  OK, so Afterbirth+ fixed this, right?  NOPE.  In fact, It's just gotten worse.  Rules governing floor layouts, item pools, game mechanics, hitboxes, enemy movement have all been changed (in a manner detrimental to any lingering enjoyment). Secret room placement, Devil Deal chances, Floor by floor Item/Boss pools have all be tweaked/changed with a vengence that would have even Lucas uttering 'Whoa, may want to tone it down a bit'  This has gone past Trolling, this is now 'Ha Ha, F@#k You' levels in each and every run.  This game is no longer fun, nor is it 'challenging' (I know someone just thought it)  Sure, this is me being bitter. I think I've thrown enough time into it over the years to be bitter about something so previously enjoyable being destroyed by either deiberate action or an over-zealous and thoughtless tweaking.  Yeah, I think the game is pretty done now and especially too much for someone to get into. Those who would enjoy it (with mod capabilities now), already are. So save your money for something else.","hours":1744.3,"funny_percent":0.25,"helpful_percent":0}

{"review":"Okay, first, look at the time I've spent in this game. No, I didn't leave it on overnight, that is actually the amount of time I have in this game.  The game was FANTASTIC at one point, but update after update (also DLC) has slowly increased the difficulty to the point of unfair levels.  The free updates have caused a slow trickle of community created content, which sounds good on paper. The problem is that most of these items are either bad or reskins of existing ones. In a game where your abilities are dictated on a dice roll, they've diluted the item pool with terrible items, indirectly making the game both harder and less fun.  Let me explain: If you play this game and don't get any damage upgrades, but get a ton of health upgrades, you're likely to die on that run. Enemy health increases as the game goes, and without your damage compensating, you'll be tickling in game enemies with a feather duster. In vanilla Rebirth, this wasn't a big issue. There were plenty of damage upgrades, and maybe a bit more health upgrades than is necessary. However, after so many updates, there just isn't enough damage to go around in lieu of \"wacky\" items from the community.  When the game works out somewhat, it's really good and has tons of replay value, but over time, it's just become a slog of \"well, I haven't gotten any damage upgrades the last few floors, better restart because the next few are both going to be extremely difficult and take an extremely long time because the odds are against me\".  You might call it burnout, but I call it artificial difficulty, and I just can't recommend this game anymore because of it. More is not always better.","hours":483.9,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.4}

While the action feels fun, the music so far is pretty good, and I like some aspects of the art style…….I’m afraid this game has a huge problem which I cannot overlook. As a staunch feminist, I’m afraid to say that this game is too sexist for me to play. The character of Isaac is too sexualized, you can even see his undergarments. Its hard to believe that still in this day and age game developers are designing characters that are purposefully made to catch the male gaze. It must be because Japan has yet to experience the culturally enriching influence of thousand/hundreds of thousands of muslim immigrants in their country. Otherwise they would have know that the better option for Isaac's character instead of that naked outfit of the patriarchy he wears in the game, would have been a burka. While I’m sure the gameplay mechanics of this game are fun, I can’t help but give it a 1/10 for pandering to the cis hetro normative patriarchal gamers, and not having enough diversity and less sexualization in the game.","hours":31,"funny_percent":0.5833333333333334,"helpful_percent":0.027777777777777776}
