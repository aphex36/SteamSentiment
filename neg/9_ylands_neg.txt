Pros: -Great Gameplay -Chock full of different items and costumization options for your character and structures -Plenty of time can be spent in just the exploration -Beautiful graphics and scenery -Weather is amazing and has a large impact on your gameplay -Large and diverse Flora ecosystem -Im able to run on ultra graphics without any stuttering or frame rate issues (at the beginning there were some but they went away) my computer isn't cheap though.  In Between: -Fauna seems lacking -In game shop, it only sells cosmetics so far though... (Skins, Emotes, ect..) -Not very difficult in terms of fighting for survival and staying full, enemies tend to die pretty quick, and those that dont are rare and easy to avoid   Cons: -Construction is very difficult to get perfect, not all the materials fit together properly, and building simple structures can be ugly and overly time consuming. You could build a house, and if you dont get the perfect measurements for length and width, your house will end up looking shabby and will probably have holes in it. -Complete lack of other \"Human-Like\" NPC's, finding a cabin or campfire but no person can be disappointing, though this is an issue that the devs have said they will resolve in future updates. -Low optimization, or more like \"Extremely\" low optimization. Despite being early access I will still put in here that this game is VERY buggy. Your movement can be jumpy (as in your character randomly climbing up short trees and bushes will traveling). While breaking things, like a fallen tree, you could end up chopping down a tree behind your character, or one 10 feet away. The boats are also incredibly buggy, as there is a chance while jumping into one that you can randomly fall through the map. Rope ladders (so far i've only seen this on boats) will somtimes end up teleporting you. I would go up one rope ladder on a boat, and end up at the top of another on a different boat. To fix this you need to destroy BOTH ladders and replace them (not a permanent fix), if you only destroy one, the ladder will end up teleporting you beneath the map. -You can't set your spawn point (so far). If you die you'll be put on the closest yland, and if you glitch out of or underneath the map (happens a lot), you have to /unstuck 1 which will take you back to your original starting point, that could be on a whole different yland. -The horse call is a hit or miss.   TLDR: In short, the gameplay is amazing and has so much potential, but the bugs are so frequent and frustrating that I must make this review a negative, until they fix the game.","hours":10.3}

I'll probably play it on and off to see if it updates and fixes a lot of the issues. I haven't experienced a ton of the issues that others have noted but I have played with people who have. It might be more forgiving to the person who is hosting the game (generally myself). However, I have seen the floating head glitch very often. Others I play with have said they can't see our ship, my head is floating, their character is swimming on land, objects disappearing. Some got booted when they were swimming and then would return and find that they had died. As far as I know when you die you respawn at your home island and I don't see any way to respawn elsewhere. When you are sailing and the glitches are this severe it makes it difficult to play if your party members are forced to respawn at a different island, rather than a bed or something like most other survival games. It's early access so I'll update my review to recommend it when it gets fixed. Until then, I can't recommend it. It costs money, it's very early development and can be unplayable for a lot of people. It is a great idea and I hope they improve it as a game. I only recommend it for those who are willing to try a cool concept while understanding it's very broken and unplayable in a lot of areas.","hours":6.8}

Unfortunately when entering multiplayer with some friends, there are ALOT of bugs to be found. It happened to us twice now that the whole server becomes broken after the host dies. Also the camera for non-host players goes crazy after dismounting a horse. It's laggy and when sailing around, you can't find new land.

Logging out and back in does not fix it. Shutting the game down entirely and restarting your PC does not fix it. I read some posts about opening your world in the editor and deleting your character and then saving a new copy of the game and then adding all your gear back in with console commands, but honestly that is way too much trouble for an early access title.
