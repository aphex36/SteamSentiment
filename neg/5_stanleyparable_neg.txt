The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of video game tropes most of the jokes will go over a typical playerâ€™s head. Thereâ€™s also the Narrator's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that theyâ€™re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike The Stanley Parable truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldnâ€™t appreciate, for instance, the humour in The Narrator's constant narration of the actions of the player character, which itself is a cryptic example of the subversion of video game narratives. Iâ€™m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Galactic Cafe's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer monitors. What fools.. how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚  And yes, by the way, i DO have a Stanley Parable tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. Itâ€™s for the ladiesâ€™ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that theyâ€™re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ðŸ˜Ž","hours":5.9}

This is the game equivalent of someone saying \"but why?\" repeatedly. It demands the player determine the significance, purpose, and meaning of all of its components, and contributes nothing of its own. The author abjectly refuses to provide their own interpretation of any of the issues raised. While I appreciate that the point of free will as a topic is to allow the player to choose, I may just as well explore the concept by washing the dishes anti-clockwise rather than clockwise. If the author didn't wish to say anything specific and unique about free will then why does this game exist? The saddening conclusion I reached is that there is little reason for it to do so.  The humour falls flat when the game counter-productively demonstrates why the mechanics it is mocking are actually extremely useful and sensible. Without a suitable target to ridicule, it just becomes whining. The game is also overly reliant on the main character and narrator \"arguing\" with one another, which is mildly amusing at first, but tires out almost immediately. The narrator really tries his best, but without a conversation partner he eventually devolves into something reminiscent of chiding a pet - just frustrated and tired.  The philosophy is vapid, the humour is half-baked and meandering. Having a great voice and beautiful appearance cannot make up for lacking an opinion on anything and frankly being dull.","hours":3.2}

There aren't any puzzles/gameplay to speak of and don't get me wrong, this would be acceptable if there was a story/experience here, but there isn't. It's basically a hallway simulator where a narrator tells you what you are doing. Don't get me wrong the voice actor is good; he's as good as Stephen Fry or David Attenborough, but timbre is not enough justify an entire game.   You'd think the narration gimmick would lay the framework for some clever meta ideas but they just don't really take it anywhere.   I actually dont recommend buying this. Just look up videos of it. It's not worth your money. The devs had a single idea and they weren't really able to come up with an interesting way of using that idea. I beat it in 20 minutes and forgot about it.

I enjoyed it thoroughly. For about 10 minutes. In my opinion its main flaw is the fact that there are other games with more engaging stories that are cheaper. As satire it succeeds on the humor front but doesn't say anything especially profound. It wraps up its lesson nicely in the first few minutes and then proceeds to repeat it as many times as possible in case you somehow didn't get the point. Then revelation will kick in: We are all Stanley. Our choices don't matter. We are all doomed to play mediocre and overhyped games.   Rating: 4/10","hours":1}
