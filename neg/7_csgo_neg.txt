I got this to play with a friend who has it, we were stoked to play together, but first the game asked if I wanted to \"turn off the X-Box DVR\" ... why or how does my laptop have whatever an X-Box DVR is?! Anyway, I clicked no, BIG MISTAKE, it lagged so bad it took almost 10 minutes to get through the start menu, I could barely play. I tried getting help too, I know a guy that's really good with computers so I gave him the instructions to turn off the DVR and he basically said what I did: he couldn't understand it. Yeah, I'm uninstalling.","hours":1.3}

It doesn't offer much of anything new except a few more gun types and skins(which cost a lot of $$$ for good ones).   I would have been happy with a solid player base and similarities of the older Counter-Strike games, which this game offers but there is a huge issue with how servers are run.  Everything is community based, there are a few but essentially no player operated servers worth frequenting. Because of this there is limited moderation. Hackers come on servers and the only way to get rid of them is if their own team votes them off; which even if the hacker is blatently wallhacking, spinbotting, and shooting through walls it just doesn't happen. Players would rather win than play honestly, and that includes letting hackers remain on their team.  Secondly, the hit registration is horrific! I'd say close to half my shots do not register. Admittedly I thought I was just bad but after watching replays I could see that my shots were infact lined up perfectly and simply did not register an impact on the server. In addition when I play LAN matches with friends enemies actually drop in 1-3 shots, not half a clip into their face and body later.  Third, the weapon recoil and damage scaling is just plain awful. The recoil is extremely high even at close quarters. There are automatic weapons (such as the P90) which can take up to four direct headshots to kill an enemy depending on range. I understand players might be wearing a helmet but that's still insane, especially if you're shooting them in the face which is exposed.  Overall it's worth getting cheap to kill some time on but it's not a balanced game in the least.","hours":152.4}

It's because? Because when you are winning 4-0, your enemy has a secret weapon. No, it's not spinbot, it's the fantastic artistic skating skills that allow you to walk around in circles and have an abysmal percentage of headshots!
