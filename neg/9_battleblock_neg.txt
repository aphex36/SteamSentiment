However, i had bought this game out of nostalgia and didn't really seem as good as it was the first time round which shows the campaign does not have much replayability. There is other things like minigames and level builders, but apart from that nothing much more. Also, this game feels almost unplayable with a keyboard and mouse, so a controller is needed to get a better experience with this game. I think if you were to buy this when it is on sale, go for it. But if it is not, then i wouldn't bother as i do not think it is actually worth the amount it costs.","hours":6.5}

I can tell this game was meant for multiplayer. The effort in the single player just...feels like it's not all that fun. Feels like it's missing something. I hate playing with strangers, and finding friends to play local coop isn't too easy for me.  My worst complaint about the game is being unable to clear your cloud save, and not able to play with a local save that can be cleared. I played it once or twice a few years ago. I come back to it and I can't get a fresh start. That option is literally not built into the game.  It's great for multiplayer if you've got people to play with, but as a single player game, I'll have to suggest passing on it.","hours":1.9}

I had the same feeling with Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends which I find very similar to this game.  To me the repetition lies in the fact that you will repeat this exact pattern all the time: start the game, start the story line, move to the next level, start, the environment is all blocky and every block had a behavior and all the levels share the same layout so everything look so similar. Find all the crystal, exit.  On the bright side:  I believe the game is more fun in multiplayer. The humour is very cool. The music is great.  Overall I think it is an incredibly repetitive game.","hours":4.4}

At some point in the beginning I had a bit of fun but it soon became a task of finishing the game just to find the funny parts.  Perhaps its funny when you play with friends, I wouldn't know since I couldn't find games (it constantly said it was all full and that I should try hosting, which did not work, I waited for a while and no one joined on different occasions)  I finally gave up and watched the cutscenes on youtube, proving once and for all that there is nothing funny in the game.  Perhaps its just not my cup of tea humor wise.  Its not a bad game in any respect but it didn't deliver on what I felt like it should have.  If you like to solve puzzles just for the heck of it you can get this game, but if you want this game because it seems like it has humor potential I would recommend you give this one a pass.","hours":3.7}
