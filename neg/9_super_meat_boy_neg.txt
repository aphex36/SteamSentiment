{"review":"I got this in a 90% off sale and still feel ripped off. Frustration is not fun. Super Mario Brothers was a challenging platformer which is still enjoyable today. Super Meat Boy is painfully not fun. Missing a single jump and having to do the level over again isn't fun. Being forced to speed through every level is not fun. Being forced to do every level perfectly is not fun. Also, the game tells you in the opening screen that you should be playing with a gamepad and it's true. The game isn't optimised for keyboards. So unless you're a complete nerd who plays PC games with a gamepad, forget it.   My advice: wait until the game is on sale at 99% off and then MAYBE consider picking it up.","hours":3.4,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.125}

I mean, even the title sounds like a sex tape made by twelve-year-olds, posted on porn hub in 2004. In fact i would go as far as to say that this is just the anal miscarriage between mario and peach.  In summary, the game is fine.","hours":1,"funny_percent":0.10526315789473684,"helpful_percent":0}
{"review":"Unfortunately I can't recommend this because I can't use my controller to play it.  It seems like an amazing little game but for some reason only this game out of my entire steam library won't work with the wireless Xbox controller.  Using the keyboard is brutal for such a fast paced reflex game like this.  I will revisit my review if they ever fix this issue.","hours":0.4,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0}
{"review":"From someone who appreciates immediate feedback from the controls I cannot recommend this game, it feels like you are controlling someone with wheels for feet. The reason they recommend the controller is beacause you can blame the unresponsive analogue stick for the latency between command input and command execution. A keyboard feels infuriating to use because it feels like you are lagging in an offline mode and I will not compensate for the lag by using an analogue stick that instead of mitigating the laggy controls only makes them harder to notice as you think the controller is at fault rather than the game. I cannot play a platformer with unresponsive movement it is like trying to jerk off with sand paper. Thats probably why only 5 percent of the player base even bothered completing the game. If they ever make a sequel I will gladly buy it provided it has responsive movement.","hours":1.9,"funny_percent":0.13043478260869565,"helpful_percent":0.34782608695652173}

Remove the creativity and solid game mechanics from the that game and this is it. Not to mention it als, for some reason, has started crashing on start up. So it needs to be started twice just to get it working. I tried to narrow it down thinking a game this simple can not possibly have a problem starting up. It never had a problem before. So what happened? Not sure.

{"review":"I could give a positive review for this game. But I won't.  This game is very good at what it is: hardcore platformer for those ppl who love such games. Most (but not all) levels designed very good.  Below are reasons why this review is negative and why I wouldn't recommend to play this game just to save your nerves: 1. Characters are almost uncontrollable. Somebody could said this game has perfect controls. BUT NO. This game in most cases is so fu**ng hard just because you cannot control precisely your character in certain cases. Authors made main character to accelerate its speed extremely fast. In addition to sliding after loosing acceleration you getting uncontrollable peace of♥♥♥♥♥♥ not a meat. 2. Balancing in the air isn't possible in most circumstances. Especially when you need to do things fast. This is also due to imbalanced acceleration. 3. Randomness of this game in some levels is third annoying thing. For example, evading rockets and black flying monsters that are split onto 8 little monsters and fly in radial directions. You almost cannot predict their behavior and how to avoid them. It is awful in hardcore game when you cannot control the process. 4. Game crashes. Yeah, such a simple game crashes everytime after locking Windows 10 screen. And this could not be a big problem - levels are short and you pass them immediately or repeat. Except one! Last level in \"The End\" chapter when you escape from boss, and then after reaching the end of level you appear in next zone. And this zone isn't available from level list screen. So, if you quit, you need to pass first part of final boss again! 5. REFUSE TO JUMP. In some cases you may fill that your character won't jump when it MUST. This is happens after colliding with any ground. If you press just nanosecond earlier, the character will not jump. Also, if you accelerate on the platform and try to jump at the end, it could not jump and drop down. It was a last drop (after failing Cotton Valley 20 level on Dark World on the LAST saw just because this b**ch refused to jump) after I really decided to write this review.  Anyway, despite of this, I still playing this game, and if you do not afraid of all bad things described above, then I would recommend it to play.","hours":95.8,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0}

{"review":"The term impossible shouldn't be used lightly.  There's no skill involved, It's multiple attempts to pass a level, until eventually you work out the levels pattern and it's environment. While doing so you're performing luck-based jumps, and wall-grinding movements, and dodgy arcs in the air to land on a small platform, avoiding monsters and swinging axes,  Until finally you finish the level and get to see a final recap of your 100 Meatboy attempts all dying along the way while following the one that makes it to the end. It seems this final recap is proving after all those attempts you've accomplished something, but I'd rather have fun playing another game than 'not enjoy' something and force myself to complete it.  You'll be dying every 10seconds, and if you're not up for a lot of resets-repeats-defeats, then you'll not enjoy this Game.  I've tried to play it 4 times in the past because it's a positive and successful game but each time in doing so I find myself shutting the game down, annoyed and rewriting my review.  The majority of the players seem to enjoy the game, therefore they feel my opinion is invalid. This game is cancer.  edit; Changed word impossible to Cancer.","hours":1.8,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.1}
{"review":"Decent game, but I can't legitimately recommend this game for performance reasons.  - The game doesn't run properly at 144 hz. - It doesn't run properly with G-Sync enabled.  This would all be fine if there was a warning or setting somewhere in the game to make you aware of this, but having to google an issue they \"must\" be aware of at this point is not a good way to go about things. When you haven't played the game before, it isn't apparent that certain animations are not running at the correct framerate. It becomes obvious at the second boss level, where the different timings literally makes it impossible with G-Sync enabled.","hours":1.3,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.3157894736842105}
