{"review":"Could use a difficulty slider or option. If I could make it easier and not die so much, might have enjoed it more. Could use ability to be either gender for any character type Could use a mod to have infinite ammo if they are not going to have difficulty option. Does not really explain the keys well when you do a new game. V for punching when you run out of ammo? I turned off 'UI sway', but still spun and swayed enough to make me feel a bit ill during play. This part is partially me, as I tend to get that condition. If you don't get sick in other first person shooters, you will probably be fine in this one. Apparently does not have different saves for single player and for network play. I had a single player game going, then created a new co-op game with friend. I went back to do my single-player, and did not see it. Granted, it could be partially that their interface is a little awkward. I found Mad Max and Fall Out in here much better games for this genre.

{"review":"After playing Borderlands TPS and this game I can say that the Borderlands franchise is LGBT propaganda.  Come on let's be honest, the first character you meet in Borderlands 2 is gay then you meet a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ called Moxxi who is bisexual, then after you meet the probably straight mechanic Scooter you meet another mechanic who is lesbian. There is also a DLC with Mr Torgue who only talks about the words badass, but himself is bisexual. Some NPCs in sanctuary have homosexual dialogue. Then when you enter Exploitation and do a quest there is a scientiest woman with a wife and a male patient with a husband. Also the guy in the Forge with the challenge arena seems to be bisexual or gay as well. You also have this lesbian in the Borderlands universe called Athena who is a lesbian too and she is a playable character in The Pre Sequal and the first character you meet in that game is a lesbian too. Oh and playable character in BL2 is bisexual too, the commando dude. Two other bisexual characters are Janey and Taffort. So my conclusion is that it's LGBT propaganda. I cannot enjoy a game where all the characters keep mentioning their homosexual relationships.","hours":81.7,"funny_percent":0.36363636363636365,"helpful_percent":0}
{"review":"This game is in my opinion, not very fun. There's way too much grinding for my liking, the combat is decent, but not as good as other games I've played. The story is slow, and doesn't pick up at all until over 10 hours into the game (if you do the side quests). The characters (or at least most of them (in my opinion)) are pretty uninteresting and generic.","hours":94.9,"funny_percent":0.058823529411764705,"helpful_percent":0.23529411764705882}
