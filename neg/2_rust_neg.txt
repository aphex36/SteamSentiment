As it stands, the player base is toxic (tons of racial slurs and swearing in the chat) and mean. You will get killed and it doesn't matter if you're logged in or not (most of my deaths seem to have happend while I wasn't even online). The only way to avoid this is to survive long enough to get a sort of base going (a heads up: you can't delete anything you've built). Also it seems each server will reset monthly to help avoid structure clutter, unfortunately that means anything you've worked towards will also get deleted and you start from scratch. As much as I wanted to enjoy this game, I just can't. As a result, I can't recommend it to anyone unless they enjoy killing/getting killed.","hours":18.5}

But there's so much about it that is frustrating as hell. Over the past 2 months I\"ve put about 130 hours in to this game, and I loved a great majority of it. The building mechanics, the survival aspect, everything is done pretty well. Not to mention the fact that it is updated frequently. I'm ok with server wipes so newer players have a chance to start a decent base every once in a while.  Here's whats bad. The player base is very hostile. It's almost impossible as a new player to find someone to show you the ropes or find someone that won't kill a naked right off the bat. And that is good enough, it shows the real nature of this survival game. The thing that really made me hate this game is the tiered structure of finding blue prints/things needed to survive. You can learn them for in game currency called scraps. They're hardre to come by but over time you can learn what you need to pretty easy if you venture in to the harder PvP parts of the map. What's ridiculous is, when the server wipes so does your memory of blue prints. This is absolutely ridiculous, there is no edge at all for solo players to come back if they're constantly trying to start from the beginning and move their way up. And I did that. But to make the grind every time a server resets is absurd. I won't be giving this game a good review. I won't recommend it, and I'm pretty much done playing with it because of that.  I get that they probalby want to enforce team play or whatever, but when you have a player base that is almost completley toxic, it's hard to jump in and start off. And I say that from owning this game for almost 2 years before giving it a very, very good try.   Pass on this.","hours":130.3}

I had a server with friends where we would build massive bases and raid them to destruction. It was mindless make and break fun. Then, the devs decided to get \"serious\" about the game and implemented a massive overhaul. Everything since has been a downward spiral.  If you simply think you can hop onto any server and start playing, you are sadly mistaken. You will be robbed, griefed, killed, and laughed at. Even if you do manage to find a good server with good people, you are still faced with some of the worst optimization issues I've ever seen in a game. Add to that the fact that this game will apparently be in \"early development\" until the end of time and you start to realize how pointless it becomes. Servers are wiped frequently, new updates bring news bugs, quantity is given preference over quality, and the game remains utterly pointless.
