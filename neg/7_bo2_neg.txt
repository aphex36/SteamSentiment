It's one of those \"Shoot first at the other player and the other player kills you.\" kind of game. The gun sounds in this game are overglorified \"poofs\". People in this game are bouncing off the walls shooting you and its really hard to play it. The weapons suck so it makes it hard to rank up to level 55, so don't even bother to prestige yourself, its not fun and its why I am making this review. I say this again. This game is HARD and FRUSTRATING. The campaign is fun and zombie mode is too.","hours":28.8}

It is strongly event based and most of time all they do is put an other little puzzle on the way, with different game mechanics. Events, puzzles and tunnel running plus bad Ai. In the end the amount of using your actual brain and not being bored out of your mind is very little. Like most of Call Of Duty games, its mostly polished surface that looks like a game but in the end is just an other player just triggering events after events. The only challenge the game gives to you is try keep playing and beliving that it will get better,","hours":17.4}

PRO : - you can choose your loadout from the start of the mission - decent graphics  - decent soundtrack - good controls - good maps CONS : - bad texture quality,especially for the weapons - bad effects quality - bad lighting quality - bad optimization (some maps are laggy and the frame rate drops suddenly,for example in the jungle) - bad and unrealistic story dominated by a terrible drug lord (Raul Menendez) - useless decisions during the campaign which influence the ending - the ending is very disappointing - many campaign weapons don't appear in multiplayer buy they should - the vehicle fights are bad and disappointing - short campaign  So,it's a pretty bad game and I advise against buying and playing it.","hours":9.7}

U can get the same game at gamestop for like $10 and its dlc is cheaper too. But at the same time i cant deny how much fun this game is. My personal favorite is the zombies mode. Its super fun (especially with friends. But the dlc is $15 each. If i were to recommend one dlc get the apocalypse one it has the best zombies map. In conclusion I really like this game. I really do.
