This game is a fun shooter. If you want a game where you go through shooting the same creatures over and over again, getting a few items here and there, this is the game for you. If you want a Fallout game to rival the previous stories and characters of the series, do not pick up this game. The world itself is bland and repetitive (except in a certain DLC), the characters are 2 dimensional, and the story itself is not all that driving or intriguing. There are good points, yes, but not enough to warrant paying more than $20 for this game. Save your money, buy The Witcher, Fallout NV, or some other RPG.","hours":333.6}

I do not recommend it because overall the game disgraces the fallout franchise as well as the playerbase that helped build it.  I can go into lengthy detail about what is right and what is wrong about the direction bethesda went with this game but ill try to just briefly summarize it as many other reviewers already cover the specifics in an accurate manner.  Basically the rpg aspect of this game is missing. The game offers an illusion of choice.   -Male or female.  -automatic or semi automatic -sneak or run and gun -yes or no(usually ends up just being a yes to another faction) -Power armor or nah -explosives or nah -Build settlements or nah -Kill or get killed   I could go on.  This game offers no real choice. It is like riding a train track that wants to tell you how you should perceive your tracks. The story is a joke and contains many occult and new world order symbolism especially with the automatons and humanity's reaction to them. This game forces aggression and most quests involve killing someone or stealing from someone. It is essentially impossible to be a pacifist although not technically impossible if you don't want to experience any story or dialogue which is probably preferrable from what is offered. It is even more impossible to impact any real positive change making the game feel very hollow and unsatisfying. It is a great Shoot em up game with some minor survival mechanics tacked on (literally much after release), mods make the game far more enjoyable but none make the game feel like a real RPG or immersive although they help push the game in a better direction.  After much time and experience with this game i can honestly say i wasted too much of my life on it and received very little enjoyment besides decapitating and exploding npcs in the first dozen hours which has become very dull to me after many hours of gaming. I would have sacrificed the combat improvements for a more overall enjoyable rpg experience like this game could and should have been.   ","hours":176.6}

Barely over 300 hours in to Fallout 4, and already deleted it from my computer.  Fallout 4 does a better job with graphics and gunplay then any prior Fallout game, but fails in basically every other way possible.   You'll see dozens upon dozens of other reviews all stating similar things to this simple statement: \"It doesn't feel like a Fallout game.\" As a shooter with RPG elements, sure, it's a good game on it's own, but as a part of the Fallout Universe? No, absolutely not.   The RPG element of the game is broken by things like repetitive quests that are advertised as voluntary, but suddenly become quite mandatory. The abandonment of the \"Karma\" system definitely hurt the feel of the game as well. The game is bright, and vibrant, which would be fine for most games, but for a world that was plunged in to nuclear winter, it's just far too bright of a game to make it a true part of the Fallout realm. That analogy even applies to the NPC's as well. Perhaps they are just moving too far forward timeline wise from the day the bombs fell, but virtually every NPC in the game doesn't seem to feel the same urgency of survival that you get from them in other Fallout games. On one hand the \"Settlement\" system is a welcome touch, but on the other it's broken on it's own and very much responsible for hurting Immersion in the game. 5 minutes in, and all of the Settlers feel the same. There are mods to help that, but, even so the generic shallowness of their overall personalities makes them all just feel the same. Impact of choice itself is heavily lacking in Fallout 4 compared to all prior Fallout games. You essentially feel pidgeonholed in to either \"Good guy\" or \"Bad Guy\" roles, but even then the \"Bad Guy\" options feel lackluster at best. You are constantly bombarded by dialogue choices that do not matter at all. Literally, no matter what button you press, the same outcome will occur. (learn from that, stop inundating players with hordes of meaningless choices! Meaningless choices should be few and far between if at all!). In a shallow way player impact on the world would seem greater because you can directly control the shape of several parts of the world, but that ultimately contributes to the lack of immersion more then helping it because most of the quests all feel far too linear in nature to truly call it a reactive world. Putting up a town seems to, and feels, like it has virtually no impact on the other settlements or cities in the game. You can build a virtually impervious fort with enough firepower and walls to hold off an army, but a dozen raiders still wind up attacking and getting inside of it? Even that, on it's own, doesn't hinder immersion as badly as a world that does not react. In Fallout 3, a great example of world reactions, is the radio itself. 3 Dog is constantly touting things you have done, or have not done, and while that partially remains true in Fallout 4, the radio broadcaster is mostly ignorant or simply does not care about the vast majority of things you do in the \"Wasteland\". On one hand this is more realistic because how could they know everything you do? On the other hand, you feel less impactful on the world in general. Now on to the music, the music is literally copy and pasted from Fallout 3. Lets just, no, don't do that. Seriously, 200 years later, in a world that has fertile ground capable of harvesting plants, it just falls flat. In fallout 3 that made more sense, because food, and clean water, were MUCH harder to get, and without those basic essentials to life, it made sense that no one really had time for leisurely activities like music. But in Fallout 4, food and water are hardly issues anymore. If you're going to continue taking the timeline further ahead, then NEW MUSIC NEEDS TO HAPPEN TOO!!!   Even with all of these problems, Bethesda is taking far too much example from companies like EA and Activision. Paid mods? After a person has spent almost $100 on the base game, and all DLC, any sponsored mods should be free after that. Pick a model, F2P, or pay up front for a full product. If you get Fallout 4 for under $15, including all DLC, then fine, put in a F2P type of model. Don't charge full price for the base game and all DLC and then behave like a F2P game.  Honestly, I won't be preordering the next Fallout game if it is made by Bethesda, and I may be boycotting the company in general if they decide to go the EA route.","hours":325.8}

And now, it's just a streamlined corportation with money on the mind and everything else left behind. The lack of passion in this and their recent greedy practices sure has shunned the face of the company in my eyes without a doubt. All in all, this is worth it, at a certain price. No doubt will you have fun and like exploring and shooting thing's but in terms of a bethesda RPG based shooter, the RPG elements are almost non existent in this one.

It's just ok compared to the other fallout games, however it lacks a lot of aspects and features that the other fallout games had. While it did improve on a lot of things, like gunplay and depth to power armor, it lacks a lot in the RPG department; the perks are very lack luster and could have easily been far better if they just kept the skills from the previous games. The story is something to be desired as well, you have really no motivation to go and find your son considering how relatively unimportant he is. I felt more inclinced to just explore and do side missions, infact, the dlc in this game has far better plot lines than the main one suprisingly. You are also given very little choice in this game when it comes to an RPG, you have to side with a faction and there isn't any karma, all of the factions aren't outright evil (it's a little subjective, the factions are more like moral compasses.); the dialouge system isn't very good either, you have very little choice in what you say and your charisma trait doesn't really play a big factor in a lot of encounters. Fallout 4 does however have some reedeming aspects that make it worth your while, the modding scene on this game is very alive (at the time of writing this.). There are a ton of mods that fix/add a lot of mechanics in this game which almost entirely redeem the game. Overall, I give this game a 6/10, I have this on console and it's just ok, I got a 2 day trial of the steam version and there wasn't much to be had, but if it's the only thing you have to play you certainly won't be dissatisfied","hours":7.2}

Story Honest opinion, the story sucks. It doesn't really make any sense when looking at the core of it. My mine gripe is it feels the plot twist that you were frozen for another 60 years not 10 seemed to have been added at the last second to make Shuan Father because between Coursers showing up in Kellog's memories (who needed Shuan's DNA to exist in the first place) and Kellog not aging at all, there are a lot of holes in the plot. All this aside, choices you make and do outside of the main story missions have no real impact to the outcome of the story. Your character is fixed on trying to find his son, becoming a drug filled cannibal or living saint really mean nothing.   Chracter Creation It's certainly a step up from what I remember, obviously mods add more flavour but without mods its still great. However this all kinda goes down the drain because your character has a voice of their own. On top of that, they have their own background, family, and personality. It indirectly really limits how far you can mold your character since they already have a background.  Dialouge The Dialogue is lacking at the best of times. Any given choices usually boil down to Yes, Sarcastic Yes/Ask for more money which means Yes, Repeat/Yes, and No. Compared to previous games, skill checks have been reduced to being chance based so no need for certain levels of Speech/Barter/etc (not like those skills were in the game) but I'll get into that later. There's also the case that what you say doesn't really matter. You could choose the rude dialogue, the NPC will be upset but then be fine and dandy like nothing happened when you return to turn in (unless you've come back to kill them, obviously). There's also the case that you have no idea what you're going to say, just a one to two word summary of what you will say. Not a big issue, just personal preference.   Gameplay The game as a whole feels a lot smoother than previous games, that's undeniable, but it's so streamlined that it feels like a generic shooter with minor RPG elements. Gunplay is amazing, no doubt. The Good Karma/Bad Karma system has been removed for the most part (it's kind of there with Companion Reputation) so your actions don't really have consequences unless you're caught. Perk Builds also don't really matter. At any point you can decide to branch out and generalize where as in previous games you had to more or less commit. Sure it goes both ways as a good and bad thing, but on my second playthrough of the game my character plays no different from the first by the end since certain skills (particuarly combar ones) become mandatory in order to keep up. Settlements are whatever, I kinda liked them.","hours":89.3}

I regret buying Fallout 4 at full price. It has great combat mechanics, the graphics upgrade makes it nice on the eyes, and the level design is pretty good. However, the majority of roleplay mechanics have been stripped away, it is cluttered with boring and meaningless side quests, and rather then taking a lesson from obsidian's Fallout New Vegas, they did the oposite. They took steps back, less depth, unkillable npcs, less options to solve quests, and more liniar and unintresting paths and quests.

Just adding my part to the review pool, and this also means I won't be playing Skyrim either after stocking up on the mods I wanted (Yeah, late like crap, but whatever). Will also stay away from Bethesda from now on. Thanks.","hours":178.9}

The art design, environments and animation are mostly an improvement from Fallout 3. I enjoyed the changes made to power armor. Despite some gripes I think that handling power armor like a vehicle of sorts was an overall plus. Weapon and armor customization is also a big plus.   The Bad: Pretty much everything else. The story is terrible. The removal of branching dialog trees and lack of any real choice is almost painful. This game would honestly be better without a story if they just focused on making an open world sandbox. Ridiculous OP weapon drops in the guise of 'fun' are a horrible design choice for a Fallout game, especially when weapon customization is already present. The constant UI noises and animations are annoying and immersion breaking. The restructuring of the damage and radiation systems to move further from a RPG are unwelcome. The introduction to the game (tutorial) is poorly done despite being a novel idea that had merit. Building your own settlements is a complete waste of time in a single player game and simply drained resources that could have been focused (and were needed) elsewhere during development. Radiant quests are a good idea but were implemented so poorly that they should have been cut. Also the bugs.   The Ugly: Bethesda has a complete disregard for the lore and mechanics of the original series. Fallout 1 and 2 were far better in terms of role play, world building, implementing their mechanics and creating cohesive experiences. There was a satisfying focus on character builds in those games that significantly changed the way you played them and experienced their worlds. Bethesda completely abandons that design philosophy and the complete restructuring of the skills system is abhorrent. Unlike the original Fallouts the solution to every problem seems to be through force. No playing as a sleazy con artist or diplomatic pacifist. Everything in this game feels like it's catered toward instant gratification and has no regard to buildup or pacing, making everything ultimately unsatisfying. So many of the features feel like afterthoughts or feature creep. This game, like Fallout 3 is an amateurish piece of fan-fiction and is why I've abandoned Bethesda as a developer.   Final Verdict: After 80+ hours and restarting the game in an attempt to find any meaningful enjoyment (which was not found) I can only recommend this game if it's on sale for $5 or less. Fallout 1, a twenty year old game is a more rewarding, varied, immersive, deeper and well thought out experience. In a landscape filled with so many great indie games that offer so much more there is no reason to bother with Fallout 4. Play the original Fallouts, pick up Underrail or Wasteland 2 or get ATOM RPG, which even in early access is still more of a true Fallout game than Bethesda could ever dream of making in it's current state. There are elements of a good game here but this is certainly not a good game.","hours":81.8}

(I still enjoyed skyrim a lot though, this however I did not)  This is a mess of game mechanic's, it has lost any amount of choice the original game's had by forcing the player into choice's constantly. The worst part about it is how much they try to hide it. Most of the time during the game you are given the 'Illusion of Choice'. They make it look like you have 3 or 4 options, but really they all result in the exactly the same but give you varying amount's of XP/Caps.  The gameplay is insanely monotonous, the sterotypical npc's with like 1-2 voicelines if that are EVEN WORSE. Having nothing interesting to say, besides some of the companions. Which even most of the companions are horrendously boring, stupid, or just annoying. Like Strong the Super Mutant, is so ♥♥♥♥ing oh my god just shut the ♥♥♥♥ up. Like here is a checklist of everything you should not do around him.  1. Don't lockpick any doors, or safes. Mmkay. 2. Don't equip power armor, even though there is no reason not too with how overpowered it is in this game. (I will revist this point later) 3. Don't be nice to anyone. You have to be a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. (Which gets you no-where in this game, all it does is bring down your reputation with factions and other companions)  Here is a checklist of thing's the character will commonly recite to the point of insanity.  1. He need's milk of human kindness. There is no obtainable milk of human kindness. So he will endlessly recite it forever, and you will never be able to resolve this issue for the possible chance of potentially making the character more enjoyable or increase affinity.  2. Generally complain about anything you do wrong to the point where I was screaming at my monitor for the character to literally just shut the ♥♥♥♥ up.  Also power armor. IMO it is far too powerful, even for the fact it was using fusion cores they are generally so easy to get that I had to stop using it. I tried scaling up the difficulty to make it a little harder but generally it was still far too easy. And I would face insane random difficulty spikes while trying to play this way when certain enemies would appear. Generally when encountering Assualtron's it was pretty much game over.   (In general some of the enemies were just laughably stupid)  All in all the game is a good time sink, but other than that the game is pretty much devoid of any character and was a completely brain dead experience. The PC port is garbage with horrible optimization, and completely trash settings including an un-changable FOV, and is switched on with Mouse Acceleration that you can't turn off, and the X-Axis Sensitivity is Halved over the Y-Axis Sensitivity. All of this can be changed but was a complete pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ and took me around 2 hour's to figure it out and actually get it work. Also the framerate is capped at 60 FPS (Which bethesda promised at launch it would not be capped)  All around a poorly handled port, and in the right hands this game could have been SO much better. I was so bored of this, I didn't even decide to purchase any of the DLC's. Also they changed the price of the $ea$on Pa$$ because they didn't actually ♥♥♥♥ing plan how much DLC they wanted to add on this palette of♥♥♥♥♥♥you can barely call a game.

If you like the universe, or are willing to mod the heck out of it to make the game more enjoyable then normal, Then sure, go ahead and get it, but I personally think this game, on its own, without lots of mods to make it -deeper- ...Just is not worth it.","hours":304.4}
