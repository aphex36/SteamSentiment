I really like the premise of Papers, Please, and have read/heard good things. Overall i wasn't impressed, everything is just depressing, annoying and grinding. I get it, that is the foundation of the whole game, and a reflection of the darker parts of our world. But there are better ways to portray this sort of stuff. This War Of Mine is a good example.  Ok so the gameplay is difficult to get your head around, but once you do, its difficult. There is alot going on at any one time, and not alot of time to do it. Calling refugees to the gate, checking the papers, cross-referencing anomalies, then questioning the person is a lot like work. There is no satisfaction to achiving a perfect score here.  Visually the graphic choice here is appauling. I get the low-end, mock 'VGA on DOS' era vibe, but it is presented with little care and looks messy.  Sound-wise, its ok. Not really much to comment on as the only music you hear is the initial theme music. The sound effects are ok. Cheap and nastly effects to fit the whole vibe of the game.  Im not sure if this is a game. Not in terms of definition. I'm trying not to be too harsh, but im not being entertained, not gaining any achivement or insight. Im definately not having fun. What i am doing, is work. Choosing to do work. Choosing to askew my own moral compas to do a job I dont really want to do, to help my family survive. I could just not play.  ","hours":0.8}

Lets start this review off by reviewing the people who comment on negative reviews of Papers Please. These are the most pretentious people ive ever met saying theres this great meaning to the game and \"oh you dont get it poor you\". That isnt to say the story line isnt fantastic. It really is but if youre getting this for the story line i highly suggest you just watch a lets play because this game gets redudant and as beaurucratic as real life real ♥♥♥♥in quick. Some of you may be into that i definitely am not. But as far as reviewing goes i just stick to pros and cons Pros -Interesting and new gameplay not something you see often at all -very compelling story sure its not the last of us but it does great for what it has -Wide variety of characters. Most you meet arent anyone special but theres a select few that really intrqigue you or make you laugh -Actual choices. You can decide whether someones life is altered in such a huge way and they all have their own reasons for entering. You can reunite families, save victims, or sabotage your own country. all depends how you play it Cons -Graphics. im not expecting far cry 4 here people but if you require me facial recognition then have all 5 seperate forms of picture id have the same ♥♥♥♥ing face on them with all 10 pixels in the right places. -Settings and ease of access. Not sure if it was anyone else but after exiting the game properly no matter what i did the game would always default the music volume to its loudest level which at least in my headphones is deafeningly loud. Alt-tabbing requires you to resume play which i didnt expect from a windowed game like this. I went in with expectations of an easy to play game i can enjoy while doing other things on my computer. -Seemingly anti-fun at times? Beginning this game is not a large learning curve but it shoots upwards rapidly having you to memorize all the rules and regulations that come with the checkpoint, that ALSO change on a daily basis giving you more forms to fill out more dates to double check names fingerprints address ID codes the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ facial recognition oh wait the filler dialogue is now important?♥♥♥♥ this  In short if you love monotonous games that require a good memory constant attention and an alright story line then this is the game for you!
