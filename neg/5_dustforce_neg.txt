These two facts combined with a really weird \"homeworld\" for selecting levels, just didn't make the gun fun. I was spending my time trying to find levels, getting mad at complicated levels when trying to get a decent score, and overall just bored if I was simply trying to finish a level.

{"review":"Sorry, I really wanted to like this and came back to it several times but...It feels good when you get in the flow, but that's too hard to do. I wish steam had a neutral recommendation because I'd give it to this game, but it doesn't so I have to give it a negative one.  I know people are going to write some dumb \"lol ur just bad git gud lolol\" comments. The problem is I played for 2 hours and I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. The double-jumping (or triple jumping with the purple character) seemed to have some nebulous rules governing it that I simply couldn't explain. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. I played around with it trying to figure out how it works, and it seemed random to me. Apparently it just has no leniency when jumping off of ledges and my initial jumps were counting as air jumps. This is just weird design, especially for a game that emphasizes speed. I can't think of another platformer that's so strict. That leniency is necessary because characters take up a 2D space on screen. You can't just pick any point beneath Mario and say \"yeah if he hangs that far off the platform he falls\" like these devs seem to have done. I've played hard games before, including From's 3D Dot Game Heroes which was downright cruel and way harder than their Souls series', but I didn't have to google the issue and forget 20 years of game experience to \"git gud.\" If I have to google your core game mechanics, you did a poor job  The level progression is also ridiculous and keeps you from playing all of the bronze levels if you don't *perfect* all of the basic ones, so you're kinda screwed if you can't do that","hours":2.1,"funny_percent":0.08333333333333333,"helpful_percent":0.25}

{"review":"I've really tried to like this game over the past 5 or so years I've owned it. I love the concept, but I really can't say I enjoy the 'feel' of the game. It has some weird momentum-based physics that give it a sort of 'floaty' feel to it. A lot of people will call this a precision-based platformer. I would call it pretentious. The devs did well to implement a series of tutorials, as they thought the game was too hard for many. However, there are still a ton of hidden mechanics that aren't explicitly taught to the player, so it's often confusing once you've completed a certain number of levels on where to head next. Until you know what's possible in the context of the game, it's really off-putting. I shouldn't have to go to forums and YouTube to determine that there are many completely obtuse things hidden in the game's mechanics in order to proceed.   Additionally, there are numerous bugs this game has, such as the game deciding it will automatically use up your double jump if you are too close to an edge. Mr Peck on YouTube has these documented, if you want some evidence of them. Tons of optimization problems, such as crashing if you alt+tab out of the window and simply setting up a controller is a nightmare if you want to switch between keyboard and gamepad; buttons across both is frustrating. They should have just used a 'set all buttons' command and let the player sequentially determine the mappings.  If I were looking for a game in this genre, it'd be Wings of Vi over this - feels way better.","hours":14,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.18181818181818182}

{"review":"Nice Idea, cool animations, feels awesome to tidy up, but it has no story and it has no difficulty to complete any level. The whole game is not about completing a challenging level, no there are no challenging levels when it comes to completing, no its about making highscores and comparing with the people around the world. Almost every level is accessable at the start, you just gather some easy taken keys and unlock all other levels. A level is completed under 1 minute. The real thing begins with doing a level over and over again until you know every jump inside out. This is a challenging task, but repeating the same thing over and over again is more like work than fun for me. Therefore I cannot recommend this game, unfortunately. I hoped for a cool game, because it had much potential imo.","hours":0.9,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.16666666666666666}

{"review":"TLDR; Supermeatboy ftw.  I have played a few more hours than shows here. Not that many more though...   I really love the idea of this game. I wish I would like it. In the end it comes down mostly to control responsiveness.  Even the simplest jumps feel hard to accomplish, movement feels jerky and if you miss a wallrun edge by a pixel the outcome is completely different and unexpected. I guess you can get used to it and \"get good\", but in this day and age there are so many games that do this right and feel natural, responsive and tight from the get-go while still having a crazy high skill ceiling. Supermeatboy: I'm looking at you and blowing a kiss.  Because of this little mistakes completely ruin your runs. Maybe it's by design, but I don't like it. I feel little mistakes should screw you a little and big mistakes screw you a lot.   Controller support exists (I play using an xbox360 controller), but it still feels funny. Some commands register on soft presses while others require full presses...  Ah and the game's pacing: While it demands big apm spikes there's more focus on precision and routing than hectic speed. So it feels weird: sluggish, complex and puzzling, kinda like that weirdly chosen soothing new age soundtrack.   Few games can make me yawn and get frustrated at the same time.","hours":0.5,"funny_percent":0,"helpful_percent":0.3333333333333333}
