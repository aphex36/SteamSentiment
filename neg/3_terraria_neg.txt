It seemed like such a simple mechanic just went without guidance. Moving forward I really don't know what my goal was supposed to be, or if there was one.

These are the Pros and Cons.  PROS:  Seemingly Endless Imagination-  The different types of blocks and armor/weapons makes this game fun to play without that feeling that you have done everything, there is almost always something left to be done.  Very Fun to Play with Friends and Family- Even if a little kid is playing this game, the family can turn off the gore aspect. And the game is multiplayer (not on the same computer, you need 2 computers) so you can play with others.  Okay Scaling- This game is great with scaling and weapons before you get into hard-mode, things are relatively easy to find, but not too easy, so you still have a sense with accomplishment, I do have a problem in Hardmode though, but I will get into that later.  CONS:  Boring After Hardmode- The game gets extremely boring after Hardmode, and to be truthful, I have stopped playing this game, it is not fun to me anymore because farming is needed to fight higher level bosses, and farming is never well-liked in any video game. This to me is so bad, I have given this a thumbs down. I think the game has a lot of potential, but compared to the other games on Steam, this game is really not worth it.   That is about it, I have conflicted opinions about this, and it could be great, but it just lacks something that keeps the sense of fun in the game.  -Sean McFarland","hours":117.2}

It is still a great game though worthy of buying to play with friends now that it is more user friendly for multiplayer. But it does not deserve a good rating overall with these pathetic tactics implemented by devs who work hard to attempt to fix the things that they somehow get the idea that are broken but aren't, rather than the things that actually are. Hopefully they get their guidance back, and I will say again  STILL WORTHY OF BUYING. ","hours":213.5}

Spend lots of times dealing with awful controls while trying to carve out tiny caves for you to deal with obnoxious jumping puzzles that YOU CREATE YOURSELF! All while tiny monsters are generated to interrupt your work. But don't fret, because there is CRAFTING that is accessed with the escape key (because that's always a convenient key to press), where you can create dinky items that you will use to painstakingly build a house. There's lots more to explore in Terraria, and if you hate your life and want to spend it creating an even crappier one (in 2-D), then Terraria is for you.","hours":0.4}
