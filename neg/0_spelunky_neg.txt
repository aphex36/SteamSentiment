You won't always, but will certainly.   Dead Cells and Rogue Legacy are impossibly hard at first, but they give you something valuable for your time invested and thus a sense of progression, making it doable in the long run.It helps too that the controls are tight and responsive and the action is quite enjoyable in and off itself.  Spelunky, however, is an exercice in masking a lack of content by inputing rogue-like elements and a extreme degree of difficulty; that way, you get to enjoy the same almost-similar-yet-recycled meal every other hour.   This is just a pointless, frustrating rinse & repeat with honestly nothing to hook you in to come back.","hours":0.4}

Playing thoughtfully is VERY heavily discouraged by the ghost. While the maps are enjoyably rendered, the fact that you really only have two types of tool (not counting the whip) makes it feel repetative. The maps feel a bit on the small side, and are still too big to take your time in, unless the exit is away from the ghost's spawn direction. There are ways to avoid the ghost, but it creates a time pressure that destroys all the fun of exploration. Later levels completely seem to drop all effort at keeping a cohesive feel...  Honestly, aside from the graphics, Caveblazers does everything Spelunky does... only a LOT better, and with far less pressure on the player to act without thinking. If I had played this first, I might be a bit more lenient on it, but even then, I would play the other game over this, hands down.","hours":0.7}

It is not Steamworld Dig. If you die, you start from scratch. You play as an adventurer delving deeper into a mine of ancient Aztec origin that allows you keep on delving deeper and deeper. If you die, you respawn at the very start. If you have unlocked a tunnel, you can skip the first few stages. However, there is no sense of progression. If anything, you start the game on a challenge mode where you have to complete the game all at once.  Gameplay-wise, it's best to play with a D-pad. The keyboard is not a good idea. You move around with the arrow keys, jump with Z and sprint with Left Shift. To pick up items, you have to hold down and press X. To use/throw items, you press X. S for throwing bombs and down+S to plant a bomb. The keys are not suited for keyboard play with no mouse input. Unlike games like Steamworld Dig, you can't create save points along the way. All you can do is meet the tunneler who will open the tunnel to a deeper level. You will always spawn at the start whenever you die.  Conclusion, I believe this game is niche and appeals to a very small group of people who want to play with their hands tied behind their backs. You are playing Hardcore mode from the get go. I believe that this is the developer's intent and they want to make it so hard that you have to keep on doing the same thing over and over again. I would have enjoyed this more if it was not rogue-like but I don't think it's recommended. I would love to play this game once the rogue-like can be removed. I greatly prefer games like Steamworld Dig.  PRO 1. Some Interesting Concepts Kali? Web Gun?  CONS 1. Way Too Hard You put it on Very Hard from the get go. It's too difficult to play.  2. No Sense of Progression but a Sense of Frustration You don't have a save point except like 5 stages down. It's too far for an average gamer like me.  3. Not Very Rewarding What interesting things do I get to do if I were to reach the next save point? I can't visualize it, so it's not so fun for me.  4. Not a Good PC Port from Console Keys are evident.  5. Bad Map Generator Some parts of the map are just surrounded by wall. Even the exit can be surrounded by wall. If you don't have a bomb or pickaxe, you are screwed. The map chills and the ghost comes out to kill you.  NEUTRAL 1. Rogue-Like While some people may love the idea, it's not for me. It has its place somewhere but off the top of my head, it imbalances the game badly.","hours":1.7}

However, the requirement for unlocking the shortcut to the fourth and final world is just unreasonable. Having to cross in a single run all three worlds, all while holding the key found in the first world is plain ridiculous. I see absolutely no point in wasting so much time of my life trying to achieve something so mindlessly difficult.

{"funny_percent":0.03286533741304065,"helpful_percent":0.010276633549184622,"review":"As a fan of the free, classic version, the HD version has disappointed me in ways I wasn't expecting.  I got this game on sale for $1.49. I originally didn't get it due to its lack of online multiplayer, but it was on sale for so cheap, I just had to get it.  Being a fan of the original Spelunky, I was hoping this one would be better. In my opinion, it's not. The biggest issue is that the button to switch to your bombs or rope is broken, and I can't find a fix for it. It should be C, but C doesn't work, and it doesn't appear in the options. I'm forced to use the quick keys (A and S), and this leads to a lot more deaths that don't feel like my fault. I also have way less control over my bombs and rope than in the original game. In the original, I could hold it, drop them down a cliff without activating them, or throw bombs after a delay so it'd explode sooner. The game has been out for 4 years, and the glitch still hasn't been fixed? Doesn't give me much hope that it ever will.  Other issues include the tutorial being much longer than the original (The original got the point across with one level!), and the tutorial isn't optional anymore. Yes, I know the controls, let me play the game already! I know how to sprint, this is literally the second time you've told me! Also, why do you enter doors with space instead of up like the original? Space is such an inconvenient key compared to up, especially since your entire left hand is on Z, X, and C. (except because of some glitch or something, C won't work.)  Even if these were fixed, I still wouldn't buy it at full price because of the biggest issue: No online multiplayer. Finding people to play with online is infinitely easier than having someone come over JUST to play Spelunky.  If you want my advice, I think you probably shouldn't get this game unless it's on sale, and just play the original. Even if it's on sale, I still wouldn't get it if I were you, but if you REALLY need to experience these issues yourself to believe them, DON'T get it at full price. It's more of a ripoff than microtransactions in free-to-play MMO games. And that's saying something, because while those are useless, they usually don't break everything else. A large number of people paid $15 for HD yet not-as-interesting graphics, a zoomed in camera that makes everything harder to see, music that doesn't fit as well, and worse controls and physics. I GUESS there are also multiplayer minigames, but if your Steam friends can't play with you, who are you gonna find? Bots? Booring!  The original has an online multiplayer mod, while HD is practically unmoddable. I think the original is a clear winner, here. A fully functioning fanmade multiplayer mod (that I've personally tested so I know it works!) AND classic graphics/rules/music/gameplay? Sign me up, I'd rather play that than suffer through another second of HD. Even if HD was free, I'd still play classic, which is free, regardless.","hours":0.9}

The graphics are decent and the concept is strong enough, but combat control is sloppy and imprecise while at the same time demanding very precise timing from the player. Frequently, both you and the bat / spider / snake you whipped take damage simultaneously, in part because your character shuffles forward rather than remaining stationary when turning to face an attacking creature. Other elements that come off as random and annoying include boulders of death that drop out of nowhere, conveniently placed arrow traps that often can't be avoided and whose projectile can deal double damage by propelling the player over a cliff, and a time limit in the form a ghost that hunts you down if you don't proceed to the exit within a few minutes.

Everyone with that look is normally a horrifically racist stereotype, if there's anyone like that at all, and here it's a playable character like anybody else.  The cons:  Everything else.  The game loves sending you back to the beginning without so much as an explanation of what you could have done better, or whether the problem was you at all. Every time you're on a perfectly good run you'll find yourself bump into one bat or something (because apparently bats kill people) and then fall onto a snake which bumps you into an arrow-shooty thingy, which launches you into spikes, which kill you and make you restart the game from the beginning.  I think I've had maybe two deaths in the nearly hundred runs I went on while hunting for whatever it is other people like about this game where I felt like there was something I could have done better or differently.   Now, devilish difficulty in games can often be a boatload of fun. The problem is, when you combine that with a randomized map, it means that nine times in ten, you end up in an impossible situation, or at the very least an unfun situation. This isn’t an impossible to solve problem though. Go try Roguelands if you want to see an incredible game totally nail the combination of the two, although be aware that it’s singleplayer is a little flimsy, and it does begin to get boring after you play it for 18 hours or so. Oh hey yeah, that reminds me, this game doesn’t have multiplayer either for some reason.  Much as I do like the turban-guy character being a thing, that's more than counterbalanced by the fact that the only way to increase your health after you've taken damage is by hitting a woman over the head with a whip, and then hauling her through the caverns, before forcing her to make out with you. I'm not making this up. Someone actually got a game like this onto steam.  Though my experience is limited, I suspect that it’s rare to see even an adult-only dating sim stoop that low.   But buckle up kiddos, because I’m not done. The next big thing is the controls. The controls are the kind of fetid garbage I’d expect from a pc port of a console port of a mobile game done by a toddler with three arms. Whether I was accidentally killing myself with a bomb key too close to other stuff, or attacking things I intended to pick up, the controls were in my way. The thing with binding multiple actions to the same button is that you need to be careful doing it. You can only pick things up by pressing the down arrow key and ‘x,’ which means that you’ll occasionally hit ‘x’ first by mistake, and end up killing the woman you were trying to pick up, or throwing your valuable weapon away. There’s a feature where you can hold down the down key to look below you, but it takes a weirdly long amount of time, and kinda bugs out a bit when it does happen. And all of that is without bringing up the most annoying issue with the controls, grabbing ledge edges. Because when you do this, the only way to get off is to jump upward. You grab ledges just by going near them though, which means that you’ll be constantly just trying to go down a hole but taking a few attempts to do it.  That’s not quite unplayably awful on general principle, but once you get the climbing gloves, it’s insufferable. It took me an entire minute just to jump down a hole. AN ENTIRE MINUTE. I ACTUALLY TIMED THIS. 63 TOTAL SECONDS, TO BE PRECISE, JUST TO MAKE THIS IDIOT STOP GRABBING THE LEDGE AND FALL ONE TIME. It astounds me that in all the playtesting that I’m beginning to think never actually happened nobody thought “Gee, this would work much better if I could just press ‘down’ and fall to the floor.”   Now, of course, high difficulty and permadeath are things you can deal with. Carefully planning every move to avoid the nigh-unavoidable is a lot of fun in certain scenarios, not to mention the fun of exploring a randomly generated world. Well, far be it from spelunky to let you actually have fun! Enter the unkillable ghost that takes you out in one hit and goes through walls that appears if you spend about 3 minutes on a level, and chases you until it kills you or you leave. Ha! Take that people who thought they could have fun here! Truly, your dastardly plans have been thwarted by the devs of spelunky once again!  Finishing a hard level that got you a bunch of times on a well designed difficult game feels AMAZING, but again, spelunky just fails to do this. Since the levels are random, you’ll never get the satisfaction of beating one that defeated you once, and getting to the end of the level, instead of giving you a satisfied feeling, usually just provides no feeling at all, or frustration about how much health you lost. Not to worry about that one, though. Your health doesn’t matter, since half the hazards in the game will kill you from full health as easily as from none, forcing you to start over your entire run, and there’s no way to tell them apart, or even tell what things will hurt you at all, save for trial and error, which is not a good choice in a game with permadeath and nothing at all that carries forward between characters. Once they’ve bashed into you though, you at least have a book about them. Most annoying among the damage types is fall damage, which happens after a remarkably small fall, stuns you, meaning it will usually combo into more damage, and is regularly impossible to avoid due to the random level design.  To summarize, my dog is a better game designer than the entire team behind this monstrosity, and I genuinely don’t even own a dog. The elements of the game seem applied so haphazardly and are so contradictory, that they simply leave the game with no actual audience to be appealing to, from a ghost that eats you if you try to play the game your way, to the game mechanic where you sexually abuse women for your own survival, there just are no redeeming features here. I cannot, however, recommend this game enough to people who hate it when a video game is in any way fun, and would really enjoy trying desperately to make their avatar do a basic thing like fall through a hole in the floor for hours on end.   It’s very rare that I’d give a videogame a 0/10, but in all honesty, I feel like Spelunky deserves far lower than this rating. Though I respect your opinion if you end up enjoying this game, I personally greatly regret not returning this game while I had the chance, and odds seem good that you'll feel the same.","hours":81.8}

Third map pack (ice caves) is just way too random. Half of the level is composed of platforms hanged in air, the other half is a pit that when you fall into you die. Ah, and there are also a lot of mines(explosives) that expolode, a lot of yetis that throw you away like crazy and probably into the pit and flying aliens that when hit explode like a bomb. Crazy.   And the last level pack (temple) is just insane. No way to beat it without being super prepared with having most of utility items, cape, crysknife, kapala and lots of health. You have like 4 HP at the beginning of each game. One hit from one fly that some mummy generate in numbers like 5-6 every like 2 seconds take about 2HP. Just do the math yourself. There is also a flying anubis type monster that generates some magic balls of player rage that spawn every second, are locked on player and deal like 10 HP damage every second. Good part that they are slow albeit that's a weak deal.  Anyways, I've beaten Olmec the Last Boss and guess what? I died because some of some random action like being hit by dead body of an enemy (that I've killed second before with anubis magic stuff), being stun locked and thrown backwards just conveniently into a pool of lava.   You know what? This game is a masterpiece from a technical point of view but from gameplay point of view it's pointless unless you like loosing. Like loosing is fun. Dwarf Fortress is fun although it's fun because of loosing that's inherently entwined within it. Spelunky is fun untill you see that no matter how hard you've prepared yourself you'll probably die because of some random stupid action that escalates quickly and eats your HP or instakills you no matter how many HP you have.  It's not even following the GIT GUD philosophy of Dark Souls. DS is fun because you hone your skill, prepare ahead and mix that with a lot of dexterity.  In Spelunky the GIT GUD philosophy goes to the thrash. You play carefully? You'll lose. You play rashly? You'll lose, just faster.  If you like to play games in which the way to the goal is more important than the goal itself then you'll probably like Spelunky very much. In other case, like me, there is a high chance that you'll see no point in a game like this.  Your buck, your choice.","hours":11.3}

Like another reviewer I have beat Risk of Rain, the new Caveblazers, which is very much like Spelunky, Rogue Legacy, Crypt of the Necrodancer, FTL, etc. I always knew there was something off about this game but felt crazy because it is so well regarded. I've had an RNG snake spit on the shopkeeper, before I even SAW the shop, and now he's trying to kill me through the entire rest of the game. I've died at the entrance to the level because RNG sets off a chain reaction off screen that sends an armed mine straight at your face. There goes your run! Just today I had two of those crushy blocks in the temple spawn in an extremely narrow passage, making it absolutely impossible to pass. It has extremely poor random level generation and if you can see past the poor RNG and cheap deaths, the overall difficulty curve is somewhat consistent until you hit the temple, in which a slew of new enemies and obstacles changes everything and the difficulty spikes well beyond anything that is reasonable. I've made it to the last boss once, died, and now I'm done. I'm tired of spending hours being at the mercy of this game, where skill and strategy mean next to nothing. If you decide to spend your money on this game, I hope you're feeling lucky!","hours":38.6}

Combat is uninteresting, enemies are fairly generic, and the majority of my deaths were a result of the level design rather than faults in my own skills. It is neither as skill-dependent as Risk of Rain nor as satisfying as Rogue Legacy","hours":24.5}

This is one of the item base games meaning that you have to use items more than skill, many traps I ran into I had to use items just to throw it or shoot it to win against a target. You run into areas that are unfair meaning you have to save your items, litteraly this means you're force to go around the level collecting enough gold to buy the next items to save you, in fact drops will kill you so your force to use items. It doesn't take much skill to use an item but it does take skill to dodge a trap.  Now some areas I ran into that you're not force to use items, where it's a clear run to the goal, which is fine.  Now the skill base things I do like are shaving the people in trouble because those have a risk and reward factor along with juggling between people versus the only challenge being how much money do you have and did you waste too many items?  Consvering items works as a challenge when you don't have a lot of items, otherwise the game is easy, though at least in those games they encourage you to think like use time and spacing to kill your target versus, \"you pressed a button! You win!\" When I got an item, it was, press a button and I win against a target. -_- now resident evil 7, you pressed a button! but your going have to think this one through... set back up at choke point or no, push through and hope to find an item to save your life? Versus, \"move around a little bit and you'll be fine!\" Litteraly, the choices are obivous to make in this game, if your very liberal with your items, your going to die, a lot, hell in a couple seconds I made it to the end of a level all because I saved my items!  Hell this wouldn't be a problem if I had to be skillful with my items at least.","hours":1.6}
