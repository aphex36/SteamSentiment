Sometimes controls aren't really responsive, and the new levels became such a visual pollution that you can't really know where you are going to land compared to older maps, and then die a lot with it. At first I thought this game was mostly about paying attention and then reacting accordingly, but I noticed that it was more about memorizing maps. Well, it's hard to memorize a map when you can't figure background from actual floors! The older levels are OK, with some issues as mentioned. The new levels stink.

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens.
