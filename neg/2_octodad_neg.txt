Sure, no other game where you can play as an octopus posing as a human comes to mind when you ask me, but somehow I feel like that particular niche wasn't necessarily one that needed to be filled. There is some fun to be had here, just watching how stupid a goddamn octopus looks in a suit, but you end up getting pretty tired of the bullsh*t physics later on. For some reason I thought this was the best game ever when I got it, so you'll see I have the achievement to find every single tie in the game.   Octodad is probably great for kids, and I gotta give the devs credit for doing something completely out there (and whoever did the intro song), but at the end of the day I can really only give it a 2/5. Compared to other physics-puzzler type games, I'm not sure how it holds up, but in my opinion it ain't worth $14.99 USD.  These devs are obviously pretty talented, and I look forward to whatever else they decide to do in the future, but for now I'm sorry but I can't recommend it at full price.","hours":11.1}

I can see the appeal as a funny idea, but there isn't enough here to make that idea a worthwhile game. You're an octopus pretending to be human and trying not to draw attention to yourself and make people notice your secret. Somehow you get married and have 2 kids... I have no idea how that makes sense. The physics alone boggles the mind!  The controls of this game remind me of I Am Bread, which is to say they aren't good. You use 4 inputs to control Octodad's 4 exposed limbs, resulting in a rag-doll motion that never succeeds at doing what you want.  The game is interesting for about 30 minutes, after which point you realize that you're literally doing the same thing over and over again with the garbage controls. Every task the game gives you involves walking to a specific location, navigating your limbs to grab one specific object, and then moving that object to a specific location. The settings you do these tasks in are the only aspect of the game that ever changes, and that's nowhere close to enough creative input to make this game worth finishing.  Do yourself a favor and just watch a funny YouTuber play the game and keep you entertained. The commentary will be vastly better than the frustration you will personally feel while flailing around in Octodad.","hours":4.3}

Or if you're looking for a silly local party game and have enough controllers for it.  Do you know those game shows where contestants have to do ridiculous tasks with giant, inflatable hands?  This is one of those.  I'm on the fence with Octodad. The idea of playing an octopus masquerading as a human is a wonderful concept... but there isn't much left after the novelty wears off.  What I think lets Octodad down is that the selling point is the inevitable chaos that arises from trying to perform simple tasks with boneless limbs flailing everywhere... but chaos is the one thing you don't really get. If you bump into someone, all you get is \"Ow! Stop it!\" and, if it happens too many times, the game restarts the level for you. So other than things being knocked over, there just isn't much to enjoy when things go wrong. In other words, you cannot terrorise a supermarket by running people over with a Segway and throwing boxes of cereal at their head. And if you can't send a small child flying by beating them with an inflatable shark... what fun can you have.  In effect: You either play properly or restart at the last checkpoint, which I feel almost runs at odds with its main draw. Once the novelty faded, it simply ended up trying to finish mundane tasks with a hindrance.  Giving credit where its due though: The story is lovely and the graphics are fun. Though you can finish the main game in about 2 hours, there's a lot more depth in the form of the collectables and extras. Every level has 3 ties cleverly hidden away, creating fun puzzles and surprisingly tricky challenges, adding some great depth to the game for those who want something more to sink their sucker-covered tentacles into. I'm not normally one for achievements, but the ones here are fun and encourage trying to do things differently or skilfully. There's certainly more beyond the surface of the main story, which is fantastic in terms of boosting the longevity of this title.  To get the most out of the game, there are 2 things I think will help greatly:  Controllers - I find that you can be too precise with a keyboard and mouse, which takes half the fun away. These make things a bit more unpredictable!  Local coop - This game supports 2-4 local players, so get some friends round and bring enough controllers (and pizza). Each person controls a limb or 2 each, resulting in a lot more delicious Overcooked-esque anarchy, shouting and laughter than if you play it alone. The short play time and light-hearted nature lend it brilliantly to be a party game.  So it was a fun game for what it was, but definitely didn't live up to the impact of trailer. It doesn't make massive waves, but it's sweet, silly and good for a chuckle if you can get more people involved.","hours":3.5}

Its main problem is that it is a physics game that wants you to constantly fail. Some levels are pretty easy and the game does enjoy throwing bana peels and other silly obstacles in your path at any given time....just to make you laugh I guess. They have the opposite effect really. Once you get further into the game and the amusement and the novelty wears off and you actually want to make progress is when it really puts the screws in. The vertical octopus obstacle course and the leaky tank are two completely bad levels to traverse. They will make you hate this game and you won't really know what you are doing wrong. The coarse one likes to see you fail by putting breaks in it constantly. The second it really wasn't balanced for success. Luckily you can change the difficulty setting so that you can never \"fail\". Still that's not a fun thing to do. THe closest other game I can hold this game against is Katamari Damacy. Another cutesy kitchy sureeal physics game. That game is whimsical while the weird gameplay is going on. This game the whimsy IS the gameplay and the more silliness it throws at you...JUST TO FAIL...the more the game itself, or rather the developers seem to be trying to make you laugh because you fail. That's not really a recipe for success. Some of the minigames around are indeed fun because of the weird octolegs you are using to play them. Others needed more testing to add fun factor. And the escaltors are also really not very fun. Maybe it should have had mouse settingws for the game. But I am convinced the leaky tank is just broken. The main character is actually one of the most appealing of any game I've played. LIke Chicken Boo from Animanias, you have to do nomral things without people realizing you are an octopus. Then every other level the story delves into you wife telling you how bad of a husband you are even though you are doing everything she asks as well as spending time with the kids. It's an innovative game. It also has a mode where multiple people can constrol different limbs. That doesn't sound playbable but it might make you laugh for a bit until you play something real. Still. Avoid this until it is 3 bucks. Cause you won't play it that much. Even if you make it through, it is short. It's an every now and then thing to cleanse your palette. But try not to break your mouse by throwing it.  Edit: Just finished the game finally. Didn't totally get better. Although the story and characters are completely endearing and completely worth getting through. However I think this is a game that demands a controller. It is just too hard to climb things with a mouse. It continually makes you slip down when you mistep. At the end is another level where if you fall you have to start over at the beginning. The bright spots of course...the story, the humour, definitely the achievements, the relatively open world to play with things. And really just doing simple menial tasks like making and drinking coffee, mowing the lawn, and making burgers...are where this game and its humor shine. When it makes you do mini games...or race against the clock...or be chansed...or climb heights that cause you to start over if you slip...that's where it could have been tweaked. A more constant level playingfield. But really the story so satisfying. This game could have easily been one of my favorites. Just buy it for 3 bucks and it's a perfect silly break.","hours":6.9}

When they played it, they had a blast and it was hilarious to watch.  After buying the game myself and playing it with a friend as local co-op I have to say that I did not enjoy it. The gameworld and its humor are adorable and the concept of chaotic controls are very interesting, but in co-op it needs to persons who are able to roleplay and immerse themselves in the role of the Octodad. Without this the game is bland and the gameplay repetitive for menial tasks.   Another huge disappointment for me was how the co-op was implemented. Without a controller no co-op is possible at all!  Even if you have one available, like I did, the controls are unevenly distributed, with one player controlling three limbs with the controller and the other using the mouse to control only one single arm. This takes away the most fun of the control scheme, as there is no chaos ensuing between the two players.  I am severely dissatisfied that this was not communicated.  So unless you own a controller for each person who wants to play, who are all willing to immerse themselves in roleplay and you really don't care about the money you will spend on this game, I will say not recommended.","hours":1.2}
