Some puzzles are pretty bad or just trial and error, kill boxes are often poorly communicated leading to deaths out of no-where, some sections are pretty difficult skill based challenges while the game is mostly a puzzle game....   There are just a lot of annoyances stacked on top of each other all eating away from the enjoyment of the game and not even painting the game black and white can save it from a painful mediocrity.

You also pound WASD like a retard for 5 minutes until you realize that this game actually uses the arrow keys, EVEN FOR THE MENU!  YA PAID FOR A MOUSE? SORRY MAN, NO CAN DO HERE. WE RUN ARROW KEYZ'S...  Wonderful, I can get past that (after some time of barely-contained rage). Begrudgingly, some games have a slow start.  I then proceed to realize I have no idea what's going on, and it piques my interest. I love a good mystery. Makes the somber atmosphere and eerie tracks fit, along with the wonderful graphics.  But I just couldn't love the controls. You can't rebind any keys, so have fun playing this game with 1 hand on the arrow keys, and the other pressing CTRL like a madman trying to interact with some of the extremely time based puzzles, which only get more frustrating when you can't actually just let go of a rope / ladder / hanging spot, you have to STRAFE to drop, and that gets really annoying REALLY fast, when it seems logical to have a drop function in a TIME-BASED PLATFORMER (when the gravity is sideways, so are the controls, and trying to wrap your head around that, whilst remebering theres no drop, [...]innner screams[...].  Otherwise, there was no elements that made me want to bond with the poor little boy I accidentaly murdured over and over, so I can't even say I got a good emotional / bonding moment with ANY character.  Oh well, the game is challenging enough, and if you like platformers, and are okay with a slightly-wonky control scheme, you should enjoy this title nonetheless.

You have no idea what you are doing or why you are doing it, basically you solve the small, easy, childish \"obstacles\" (do not even try to call them puzzles) just because it's a videogame and you know you are supposed to do it.  There is no immersion at all, no \"let's see what's next\" ('cause there is nothing before, why to expect something next?), no sense of accomplishment -as said obstacles are really child level, so you don't feel rewarded to have solved them plus the game does nothing to acknowledge you have passed them.  Then, most of the obstacles are of the kind \"no idea there is an obstacle->die->try->die->try->solved\": most of the obstacles are hidden or not obvious until you get killed by them, they don't give you any specific idea of how things will turn out, so you can't plan or build a strategy.

It's beautiful and all, but don't ask me what it's about because there's nothing to indicate anything - no story, nothing. You drown in tiny pools, anything can kill you - OR NOT, whatevs - random things will just kill you without warning, so you have to restart from the checkpoint and make sure you remember that thing that just falls out of the sky everytime at that one point so you have to slow down a tiny bit or die. SO ANNOYING.  I find game mechanics like this to be cheap and incredibly frustrating. Go, die, repeat, go, die, repeat. It's just a bunch of random things that will kill you, causing you to start back at the checkpoint, that you easily overcome once you're aware that it's going to happen, then the next surprise thing kills you and you repeat it all over again.  You just walk along and BAM, that log collapses and you fall into a pool of water. Dead, restart from checkpoint. Walk along, log collapses but you've jumped to the cliff edge. Then a tire drops on your head. Dead, restart from checkpoint. Log collapse, jump to cliff, tire, run back, hide under other log - but there's a spider. Dead, restart from checkpoint. Log, cliff, tire, run, hide, jump over spider leg to rope but rope drops you into pit. Dead, restart from checkpoint.  It's really just a repeating thing, over and over again, with slight variations every time, SO ANNOYING. Something kills you, restart, rinse, repeat. Dead, restart from checkpoint. You just walk along and BAM. I find game mechanics like this to be incredibly cheap and so frustrating. You drown in tiny pools, anything can kill you - or not. Go, die, repeat, go, die, repeat.

Unfortunately it was a big disappointment. Nothing in the game was explained. No idea what was going on the entire game. A lot of questions were at the back of my mind. Only knew I was solving puzzles to get to someone.  Let's not begin with the frustration of the puzzles. You don't actually solve it by thinking. You find a way by dying countless times. You die repeat die repeat until you get the timings right. Sometimes, something just kills you and then you'll know what to do next when you repeat. It's annoying. Movements were clunky so you have to take your movements into consideration to a certain degree.  9/10 for creativity, and atmosphere. Sadly a not recommended from me. Seemed pointless, actually.
