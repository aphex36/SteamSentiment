There's so much praise for this game but IMHO it's really nothing special. I really do appreciate what the devs have tried to do here, and a lot of people seem to enjoy it so that's great, however IMO it's a complete waste of time. Maybe somehow the contols just rub me the wrong way. Idk.  It's really obnoxious how many people call this a \"perfect\" game. As if games haven't improved since the SNES. Of course the visuals and music are fantastic, but the character moves painfully slow and the controls are frustrating as hell. The combat is clearly based on Ducktales, which was one of my very favorite games back on the NES, but instead of those incredible controls, Shovel Knight decides for itself when it wants to \"pogo.\" Combined with the levels being based around instant death, this is incredibly stupid.  Let me ask you this... How would you like it if in Dark Souls if your souls dropped on death were in an impossible spot to reach 50% of the time? That aspect of the game is unarguably BROKEN. Do you want me to pick up the money dropped on death or not?  Long story short, I can never play for more than an hour or so before rage quitting. I've installed and uninstalled this game at least 5 times trying to give it another shot, but every. single. time I end up hating my life and rethinking the time I've wasted on games like this that I don't enjoy and have nothing to offer other than pure frustration.

The mechanics are very simple: jump and shovel. This is both a blessing and a curse, as the player doesn't have to overthink the controls, which is great, but also leaves a lot to be desired when you get annoyed with the gameplay.  And I'm surprised not many other people are.  From what I've played it is painfully slow, and since the controls are simple, overcompensates with annoying, difficult levels. There's no dash, so you WILL watch yourself die, over and over, and then get that nice nostalgic 5 second long death screen where you watch all the money you've earned taken from you, followed by another 3 seconds to re-pick the same level on the map. Maybe that emulates the \"good old days\" but I personally find that frustrating when I'm already annoyed enough and just want a straightforward, no delay way to give it another go. It just feels like a waste of time. Let me press A and re-spawn. The enemies are just dull nuisances that aren't really dynamic enough for me to give a damn. I feel like I'm grinding my way past them, and when I kill one, I have to wait around to pick up all their gems. Again, it's too slow. If you find yourself excessively frustrated, and maybe just want to give the story a fair shot, there is no way to turn down the difficulty either, which is really the worst part, because you can't even give it a chance if you wanted to.  I don't recommend this game, but that's just me.  Platformers I recommend are Super Meat Boy, for a fast-running challenge, and Cave Story, with unique weapons and lovable 8-bit style.","hours":2}

I have a love/hate relationship with this game. Why? It reminds me of the \"good ol' NES days.\" If you actually recall those days accurately, and not just through a haze of nostalgia, you'll remember that some of those games were TOUGH! And FRUSTRATING! And I don't mean tough or frustrating as in how modern games are. I mean tough as in you'll have to die just to figure out how to use certain items, get past certain areas, etc.   I die and die and die. Sometimes I find interesting artifacts that may make certain parts of the stages easier. Over the course of many deaths, I slog forward an inch at a time, only to die and go back to the checkpoint again. But at least I get really good at getting past that one inch of screen. Too bad the next inch of screen is more of the same BS but different enough, so I'll have to die there too, in order to learn how to get past it.   As you get further into the game, the platforming becomes ever more intense. At least the controls are tight, and the game is made for a controller. Don't even bother trying this game with a keyboard/mouse combo, I'd say. The precision necessary is too great at some parts, unless you're a keyboard god.   If you find yourself getting frustrated easily at challenging games, I would say take a pass. If, however, you have a sadistic streak for tight platformers, go ahead and buy this game. After all, you're getting 4 games in one. Maybe I'll like the other stories better, but Sir Shovel can straight shove it, as far as I'm concerned. I get much too angry playing this game to enjoy it any. If you've ever watched Mike Mattei of \"Angry Video Game Nerd\" fame, you'll understand the rage of which I speak.","hours":7}

The fact that the more money you have, the more you lose is infuriating. If you lose gold in a certain spot, say bye to about 800 gold.

I don't know how good controls are compared to the older platformers but it feels slightly clunky. Sometimes you can't dodge an attack, sometimes you have to leave a frame because the brown mice didn't move as they should have. Sometimes you fall 3 frames down because the developper thought it would be funny to make floorless frames. But the most annoying part is the loss of gold when you die. It's not a problem in Dark Souls or Hollow Knight since you can easily get back what you've lost as long as you don't die again. But in Shovel Knight if you fall down in a pit there is no way you're getting it back unless you fall down again hoping the bags will appear higher (because it was too hard for them to place the bags on the floor). The only way to get the money back is to restart the level. I've done it dozens of time. Guess what : it's not fun. Another issue : half of the items you will earn during the playthrough are totally useless outside their own level. I think this is a lazy deisgn and the last levels could have been way more interesting.  Overall : good bosses but bad level design and useless items  Edit : Tried Plague Knight and Specter Knight. Plague Knight is even more clunky, and spending time in the menu to change bombs while fighting breaks the flow. HOWEVER, Specter Knight is way smoother gameplaywise and I had a blast playing him. Sadly the gold loss issue remains the same and Specter's hitbox doesn't match the visual, making some jumps very hard .That can't be acceptable in 2017.","hours":18.6}

I played many of the NES and Master System platformers when those systems were still new, and had hoped to see a new contender in the oldschool platforming subgenre. I thoroughly enjoyed Super Meat Boy, even though I never did get good enough at it to beat the hardest unlockable levels. I find 20XX delightful, and have had a great time with Terraria. Shovel Knight is something else. It's a game that describes 8-bit platformers in meticulous detail for the people who didn't get to play them in the old days.  Shovel Knight takes great care to look like an 8-bit platformer, character model sizes notwithstanding, and succeeds admirably at that effort. Everything from the chiptune sound to the clunky menus are preserved in a historically accurate manner. The animations don't have many frames and the things that are and aren't platforms aren't always easy to discern at first glance. If it had been released on the NES in the early 1990s, it would've been regarded as a technological marvel and a pretty good platformer. Not as good as Super Mario Bros 2 and 3, but better than Street Fighter 2010 or Wrath Of The Black Manta. A solid 7/10.   So why don't I recommend it? If you've been frustrated by the likes of the Adventure Island series, Duck Tales, Jacky Chan's Action Kung Fu, Master Blaster, or Mega Man 4, you know what to expect when Shovel Knight gets frustrating. It simulates that sensation flawlessly. What it doesn't provide is the fun of the aforementioned games, or enough of its own fun to make up the difference. If you're an old gamer who's played a lot of platformers, there's virtually no chance that you haven't already played a better game. If given the choice between Shovel Knight and any of the classics from the old days, Shovel Knight simply doesn't stand a chance. And the best modern 2d platformers (see 20XX, Super Meat Boy, Terraria, etc.) are much better, too. It's not a bad game. In fact, it's actually pretty good, but it's hopelessly outclassed by both the old and the new classics. At just over 2 hours with Shovel Knight, I'm already far too sick and tired of it to finish it, and so I'm giving it the tumbs down.","hours":2.6}

I'm going to disagree with those. I found it mediocre at best, with the difficulty being due more to controls leaving most deaths just feeling cheap. I've occasionally heard that the Plague of Shadows part is better than the Shovel Knight part so I stuck out the original game to the end, but once I got the the Plague of Shadows part, even that wasn't much different. I don't like how the characters handle, their sluggish movements, how the levels are repetitively designed around twitchy instant deaths (which aren't too bad in games that you can navigate around them better), how you are often hit by enemies you already destroyed that regenerate if you move so slightly off that part of the screen. It seems the only time the characters react quickly is when they get hit and knocked into yet another bottomless pit (or when you do the hitting and knock yourself into the pit). I found I mostly just spammed the temporary invincibility item and hoped for the best in the boss fights.  To the game's credit, it runs well (it was easy to run in the background and play in short bursts) and the artwork does look pretty nice. I wouldn't say this is a too terrible game, but I wouldn't call it good either, and I certainty don't see how it lives up to the hype. If Steam allowed numerical ratings instead of the thumbs up/down system, I'd probably give this a 2/5.  In the end, I found it generic, bland, generally not much fun, and I don't see what distinguishes this from other similar platformers, or how it gets so much more praise.","hours":52.1}

There's interesting boss mechanics that are unique but also have a counter to. The story is quite nice and although there's not much time dedicated to it, it's enough to get the point across and done very well. My main issue is the difficulty in controlling your character. If you're going for a difficult game that makes you learn by error with repeated attempts, I would actually recommend it.  Also, after doing some research it seems people that post postive reviews are going around downvoting/harrassing negative reviews. That's quite sad honestly and is a detriment to consumers.

The hit detection mechanics strongly favor the enemies, and the delay between pressing an attack and the attack actually occurring makes for frustratingly difficult combat, where your attempt to, for example, time a jump and attack is foiled by the delay between button presses and what actually occurs on the screen, while the enemy is able to instantly react to your actions and damage you.","hours":1.4}

It is definitely a good soundtrack, but not for this game. A soundtrack is supposed to create an atmosphere, and this one completely misses the mark in that regard.  The movement/combat is extremely clunky and not polished at all. I give yacht club credit for creating their own engine to run this game, but damn.   I really really want to enjoy this game, but I just can't. Overrated/10","hours":1}

As expected in that type of game, there are times that it's incredibly satisfying and times that it's frustrating beyond belief.   There were two major issues for me when working through this one.  1) No ability to save mid-level. I understand that's part of what they're trying to recreate, but there were a few levels where I had to leave my computer on for hours on end to avoid losing my progress. And it's not fun enough to want to rerun most of a level again. Saving at the most recent checkpoint would be perfect and really is something I expect anymore.  2) I'm sure it's a chance to show off your confidence, but there is an option to destroy checkpoints in order to get a monetary reward. That's fine. But this was triggered on accident for me multiple times while either getting attacked at the checkpoint or trying to jump and accidentally doing a shovel drop. There should be an option to confirm that you want to destroy the checkpoints or at least make them take multiple hits to break.  I liked the game, but my frustration outweighed my enjoyment.","hours":26}

I'd give it great ratings as a retro NES style platformer but maybe I just wanted more in it than that. Spoiled by Splunky!  If you like a repetitive retro themed platformer... give it a go.

{"funny_percent":0.1623003853509576,"helpful_percent":0.4189870282852524,"review":"TL;DR on bottom. As a huge fan of retro gaming I had high expectations for this one, with all the hype surrounding this game. It felt disappointing for the most part. After 1,5 hours in I felt like I should get a refund because I didn't enjoy the game so far. Way too easy and just plain boring. But I really wanted to give it another chance and kept playing - it was not worth so in the end.  Things I liked: Your hero and attack is somewhat unique (after a while the shovel concept becomes boring and it not satisfying anymore). Soundtrack. Humor is good at times. Art and style of the game - although the game has an identity crisis, not knowing if it wants to settle in 8 or 16bit era - that felt strange to me. Nontheless art is well done.  Things I did not like: Difficulty is not well balanced - most of the time it is too easy, (e.g. too many checkpoints and bosses are too easy) I never needed to even use a single potion in the game. The upgrade weapon/armor system and special attacks are either useless or make the game even more unbalanced and easier. The relic system is completly unbalanced too, you will overuse the same 2-3 spells again and again because they are overpowered and ruin the game mechanics. At the same time you will rarely ever use the other 8 relics.  I didn't like the level design, most part is boring and feels like I am replaying MegaMan. Some of it feels like they ran out of original ideas and simply copied MegaMan 2.  All the secrets don't feel rewarding at all - either music notes/gold. Most of the time it is not worth the hassle of finding them because there is zero lack in gold in the game and there are special stages which reward you way too high with currency - the whole gold distrubution (e.g. from destroyed objects) is not well balanced and there is hardly any need for the upgrades because there is so little use for it due to the casual difficulty.  The challenge mode is a joke in my opinion: like 10 challenges which are way too easy, imagine a 8 year old creating levels in super mario maker, those would be more fun than these challenges. The rest of challenge mode are the old boss battles with time limits.   The final boss battle was a huge dissapointment for me, it felt like the devs got lazy.  After first completion you pretty much play the same exact boring levels, but with another hero with a new concept: moves slower, which is annoying - but has sort of a double/triple jump ability. So for me there is no replay value after first completion- around 10 bucks for 8-9 hours of gameplay, which I did not enjoy in many aspects. Maybe this game is only marketed towards casual players. I find there are better indie options available in Steam.  TL;DR: Don't pick this up if you are used to a high difficulty level - this game will bore you. Probably fine for casuals. I would only pick this up again for 2-3 bucks, I don't think it is worth much more and I cannot understand why this game got so much hype.There are better indie choices out there.","hours":9.7}
